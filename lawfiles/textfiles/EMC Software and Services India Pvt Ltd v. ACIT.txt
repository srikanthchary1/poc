Software and Exports Ltd., and Cigniti Technologies Lt d., were 
accepted.  Further, the assessee had selected 12 co mpanies as 
comparable companies for ITES segment and all the 12  
companies were rejected by the TPO.  The ld. TPO afte r 
applying certain filters noted above,  selected 15 co mpanies and 
calculated median at 25.64% for the SWD  segment an d in the 
case of ITES segments, 10 companies were selected by  the TPO 
and  calculated median at 23.92%.  The assessee was i ssued 
show cause notice and the assessee filed objections for both the

Page 11 of 61 
requested to furnish invoice wise aging details of o utstanding 
receivables, in respect of all invoices raised durin g the F.Y. 
2015-16 as well as the invoices which were raised in  previous 
year but remained unpaid on the opening day of curre nt F.Y. 
2015-16 is-a-vis credit period as per the service agr eement 
with the AEs . The above information was called  fr om the 
taxpayer to calculate the interest chargeable on de layed 
receivables  as the delayed receipts are proposed to be treated 
as 'unsecured loans'. In response to that the taxpa yer vide reply 
dated 30/09/2019 has contested that it's a debt free co mpany 
and has not incurred any interest expenditure, accord ingly, no 
notional  adjustment can be made on account of intere st on any 
delayed payment if any, for collection of receivable from its AEs.  
To raise the above argument, the taxpayer has relie d on 
judgment – Pr.CIT-2 Vs. M/s Bechtel India Pvt. Ltd.-(C C No(s)

2.7 The assessee is debt free company and no adjustmen t can 
be made.  After considering the submission of the as sessee and 
relying on some case law, no adjustment was made tow ards the 
interest on delayed trade receivables.  Accordingly, the ld. TPO 
proposed to adjustment for arms length price of 
Rs.145,80,20,000/- for SWD & ITeS segments and passe d order.  
The AO after receipt of the TPO’s order passed order u/s 
92CA(3) of the Act. He proceeded to complete the draf t

development, quality assurance and testing, applica tion maintenance and 
support, strategic consulting, in respect of which diverse services, segmental 
details are unavailable.  
 
The company is engaged in development of platform s ervices and is 
rendering data analytics services, which are differ ent from the routine SWD 
services rendered by the Appellant. The data analyt ics services rendered by theIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021

Significant related party transactions: 
It is submitted that during the year under consider ation, the company has 
related party transactions in excess of 15%. In vie w of presence of significant 
related party transactions, the company’s transacti on cannot be termed as an 
uncontrolled transaction, and therefore the company  ought to be excluded 
from the final list of comparables.  
 
Wide fluctuation in margin: 
It is submitted that the company, during the FY 201 3-14 and 2014-15 had a 
turnover of Rs. 351.88 crores and 345.51 crores, an d profit margin of 24.14% 
and 32.75%, respectively. However, during the FY 20 15-16, the company 
realised a turnover of Rs. 171.41 crores, leading t o loss of -2.09%. It is 
submitted that there is an apparent wide fluctuatio n in the margin of the 
company. The relevant details as computed by the TP O is provided hereunder:

Operating 
revenue 171.41 345.50 351.89 
Operating cost 175.07 260.26 283.47 
Operating profit -3.66 85.24 68.42 
OP/OC -2.09% 32.75% 24.14% 
  
The reason for decline in margin is attributable to  the strategic shift 
made by the company as it is making substantial inv estments in a) 
developing tools and platforms and b) sales and mar keting to enhance its 
customer base. Further, there is a significant drop  in revenue (51 percent) 
vis-à-vis the previous year. Further, the company r ecognizes that this shift 
has impact on the margin of the company. In view of  the same, the company 
ought to be excluded.

It is submitted that the company owns significant i ntangible assets. 
The company is also developing further intangible a ssets. The total value of 
intangible  assets as a percentage of fixed assets is 17.3%, which is

operates in a different business model.   
Detailed submissions in this regard are placed at p ages 39-50 and 
479-496 of the paperbook. 
As regards application of RPT filter at 15%, relian ce is placed on the 
decision of this Hon’ble Tribunal in the case of 24/7 Customer.Com (P.) Ltd. 
v. DCIT  reported in [2012] 28 taxmann.com 258 (Bangalore).  As regards 
functional comparability, reliance is placed on the  decision of this Hon’ble 
Tribunal in Arm Embedded Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT  (order dated 
30.08.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 235/Bang/2021) for  assessment year

46.90%, 47.92% and 47.01% of its total expenditure during the FYs 2013-14, 
2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively, which suggests t hat is engaged in 
provision of onsite services. Hence, it operates on  a business model different 
from that of the Appellant and is thus incomparable  to it.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021

thus preyed for this comparable to be excluded from  the final list due to lack of 
segmental data.  
13. Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd .: It is submitted that this company is 
functionally dissimilar to the assessee on various counts and therefore deserves to be

This company provides software engineering services  primarily in Custom 
Application Development, Content Management Systems , Enterprise Mobility, Big 
Data Analytics. He placed reliance on page 1668 of annual report paper book. The 
services rendered by this company are different fro m the routine low end software 
development services rendered by the assessee as a captive service provider to its AE. 
The Ld.AR further submitted that, segmental details  of such diverse activities carried 
on by this company are not available. He thus praye d for exclusion of this company

Page 29 of 61 
        On the contrary, the Ld.DR relied on the or ders passed by the authorities below.  
           We have perused the submissions advanced  by both sides in light of records 
placed before us.  
16.       We note that the decision of Hon’ble Delh i Tribunal in case of Global Logic 
India Ltd.,(supra) considered these comparables for  assessment year 2016-17 and 
has held them to be functionally not similar with a  captive service provider like that 
of the assessee before us. Further The assessee in Global Logic India Ltd.,(supra) is 
also as captive service provider as observed by Hon ’ble Delhi Tribunal therein. 
Hon’ble Tribunal observed as under:  
COMPARABLE COMPANIES SOUGHTTO BE EXCLUDED BY THE TA XPAYER LARSEN 
& TOUBRO INFOTECH LTD. (L&T)  
14.   The taxpayer sought to exclude L&T from the f inal set of comparables chosen by 
the ld. TPO for the purpose of benchmarking its int ernational transactions qua SDS 
on the grounds inter alia that it is functionally d issimilar; that its segmental data is 
not available; that L&T is a huge brand with owners hip of intangibles and on 
account of extra ordinary event; and on the ground that this company was rejected 
in taxpayer's own case in Global Logic India Ltd. v . Dy. CIT [2020] 117 taxmann.com 
39 (Delhi - Trib.).  
15.       However, on the other hand, ld. DR for th e Revenue opposed the contentions 
raised by the taxpayer to exclude L&T as a comparab le on the grounds inter alia that 
this comparable was chosen by the taxpayer itself a nd in case of TNMM applied for 
benchmarking the international transactions minor d issimilarities are not to be 
taken into account; that the taxpayer cannot be tak en as a captive entity as its 
spectrum is much more and it is also a global brand  having presence in many 
countries and relied upon the order passed by the l d. TPO/ld. DRP.  
16.      When we examine profile of L&T from its fi nancials, available at pages 6, 7 & 
11 of the paper book, it is into providing applicat ion development and maintenance 
services providing digital solutions such as big da ta analytics, enterprise computing, 
cognitive computing, infrastructure management serv ices and enterprise solutions. 
It has also been awarded and recognized by various forums for providing such niche 
services in the field of innovation in information technology category, analytics 
solutions/services etc., explained at page 11 of th e paper book.  
17.       When we examine Notes forming Parts of Ac counts at page 116 of the paper 
book, it is evident that L&T is having two segment accounts, namely, (i) Services 
Cluster Segment which includes Banking and Financia l Services, Insurance, Media & 
Entertainment, Travel & Logistics and Healthcare, a nd (ii) Industrial Cluster 
Segments which consists of Hi Tech and Consumer Ele ctronics, Consumer Retail & 
Pharma, Energy & Process, Automobile & Aerospace, P lant Equipment & Industrial 
Machinery, Utilities and E&C. But aforesaid various  segments do not indicate profit 
earned from provisions of SDS. Apart from it, L&T i s a huge brand having ownership 
of significant intangibles to the tune of Rs. 7.42 millions, as is evident from its 
financials at pages 8 and 103 of the paper book.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 30 of 61 
18.     Co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal rejected L&T in taxpayer's own case for AY 
2014-15 (supra), available at pages 61 to 63 of the  case law paper book, by 
returning following findings :—  
  "6.6 The next objection of the assessee is regard ing multiple segments. 
From segment reporting on page S-1258 of the Annual  Report (page 129 
of PB-2), we find that the assessee has reported th ree business segments. 
The first segment is service cluster which includes  banking, financial 
services, insurance, media and entertainment, trave l and logistics and 
healthcare. The second segment industry cluster whi ch includes Hi Tech 
and consumer electronics, consumer, retail and Phar ma, energy and 
process, auto Mobile and aerospace, plant equipment  and industrial 
machinery, utilities and E &C. The third segment, i s telecom segment 
which refers to product engineering services (PES) which has been 
discontinued in this year. Regarding the PES, in Di rector's report, 
(available on page S-1225 of the Annual Report or p age 96 of PB-2), it is 
reported as under :  
"TRANSFER OF PRODUCT ENGINEERING SERVICES (PES) BUS INESS TO 
L&T TECHNOLOGY SERVICES LIMITED (LTTSL) AND WINDING  UP OF 
GDA TECHNOLOGIES INC. (GDA INC.) As part of busines s restructuring 
undertaken within L&T Group, it was decided to cons olidate the 
engineering services business under a separate subs idiary of L&T, L&T 
Technology Services Ltd. (LTTSL). Pursuant to this,  the Company initiated 
and completed transfer of its Product Engineering S ervices (PES) Business 
Unit to LTTSL effective January 1, 2014, PES Busine ss Unit was 
transferred by way of slump sale for total sales co nsideration of Rs. 489.53 
crs based on ITA No. 4740/Del./2018 fair valuation,  GDA Technologies 
Inc., USA (GDA Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company was part 
of PES business with synergy in terms of the end cu stomers they serve, 
primarily the semiconductor companies. Over last fe w years, the 
performance of GDA Inc. was adversely affected resu lting in falling 
revenues and operational losses. Consequent to the transfer of PES 
business, certain IPs (Intellectual Properties) own ed by GDA Inc. were 
transferred to LTTSL, the Company was wound up duri ng the year."  
 6.7 In view of the above reporting, it is clear th at under the telecom 
segment, the assessee was engaged in providing engi neering services, 
which is distinct from the services of the software  development. Thus, at 
entity level, the company cannot be considered func tionally similar to the 
assessee. The company cannot be considered comparab le at the segment 
level also because of there are expenses of Rs. 205 ,80,17,445/- ( page 129 
of PB-2) , which has not been allocated into three segments, and thus the 
segmental result are distorted.  
6.8 During the year, the extraordinary event of dem erger of product 
engineering service business (PES) has occurred wit h effect from 
01/01/2014, which has also impacted the profit of t he company at theIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 31 of 61 
entity level. In the decision of the Tribunal in ca se of Xchanging 
Technology Service India Private Limited (ITA No. 1 897/Del./2004), 
which has been approved the Hon'ble High Court in I TA No. 813/2015 , 
the company is held to be not valid comparable on a ccount of 
extraordinary events. Thus, In view of the extraord inary event in the year 
under consideration also, this company is liable to  be excluded from the 
set of the comparable."  
19. In taxpayer's own case in Global Logic India (P .) Ltd. v. DCIT [IT 
Appeal No. 8726 (Delhi) of 2019, dated 29-6-2020] L &T was 
excluded by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal by  returning 
following findings :—  
"20. The Tribunal in assessee's own case in ITA No.  4740/Del/2018 
relating to Assessment Year 2014-15 vide order date d 1-5-2020 has 
directed the exclusion of the said concern from the  final list of 
comparables while benchmarking the ALP of the inter national 
transaction by the assessee with its AE. Before par ting, we may also 
refer to an extraordinary event under which Larsen & Toubro 
Infotech Ltd. initiated and completed transfer of i ts Product 
Engineering Services Business (PES) Unit to L&T Tec hnology 
Services Ltd. w.e.f. January 1, 2014 as part of the  business 
restructuring undertaken within the Larsen & Toubro  group. 
Though the initiation started from 1-1-2014 but the  whole effect of 
the transaction was during the year under considera tion. Further, 
Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. during the year under  consideration 
acquired Information Systems Resource Centre Privat e limited 
("ISRC") thereby making it wholly owned subsidiary and because of 
such extraordinary event of acquisition, the said c oncern cannot be 
held to be a valid comparable and thus has to be ex cluded from the 
final set of comparable. Accordingly, we hold so."  
20. In view of the facts inter alia that L&T is int o various segments 
having no segmental financials, having huge brand v alue and 
intangibles is not a suitable comparable vis-à-vis taxpayer which 
was working as a captive entity and that contention  raised by the 
ld. DR that under TNMM minor dissimilarities do not  affect the 
overall comparability is not sustainable because th ough it is a 
taxpayer's own comparable but there being no estopp el against 
statute and that taxpayer can rectify its mistake a t any stage of the 
proceedings. Secondly, it is not a case of minor di ssimilarities rather 
it is a case of functional dissimilarity and non-av ailability of 
segmental financials to provide the clear picture q ua profit earned 
by the company from provisions of SDS. L&T is a big  brand having 
ownership of huge intangibles which ought to provid e competitive 
advantage to the taxpayer in the form of premium pr icing and huge 
volume of business ultimately leading to the higher  profitability. So,IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 32 of 61 
we are of the considered view that L&T is not a sui table comparable 
vis-à-vis the taxpayer, hence ordered to be exclude d . 
 THIRDWARE SOLUTION LTD. (THIRDWARE)  
40.       The taxpayer sought exclusion of Thirdwar e on the ground that it is 
functionally dissimilar vis-à-vis the taxpayer. How ever, on the other hand, ld. 
DR for the Revenue relied upon the orders passed by  the ld. TPO/ld. DRP to 
retain this comparable.  
41.     Perusal of Notes - Additional Information a nd Profit & Loss account, 
available at page 570 of the annual reports paper b ook, shows that it has 
income earned from sale of licence and provision of  training services also 
under the head 'software services from local unit',  'export of software 
services', 'revenue from subscription & training' a nd 'sale of licence' to the 
tune of Rs. 2809.62 lakhs, Rs. 19285.11 lakhs, Rs. 32.59 lakhs & Rs. 8.77 lakhs 
respectively. The taxpayer has also brought on reco rd website of the 
company, available at pages 71 to 73 of the appeal memo, which shows that 
Thirdware is having competency in providing service s in most advanced and 
niche area of technologies such as Robotic Process Automation, Big Data 
Analytics& Cloud Computing.  
42.   From the profile of Thirdware it has come on record that Thirdware is 
functionally dissimilar vis-à-vis the taxpayer as i t has been deriving income 
from sale of licence and software services export f rom SEZ unit and revenue 
from subscription and training etc. and it is also into sale of licence and its 
segmental financials are not available.  
43.    Thirdware has been ordered to be excluded by  the coordinate Bench of 
the Tribunal in case of Fiserve India (P.) Ltd. v. ITO [2015] 60 taxmann.com 
48 (Delhi - Trib.) on ground of dissimilarity to ro utine software development 
service provider which has been affirmed by Hon'ble  Delhi High Court in ITA 
17/2016 order dated 6-1-2016. So, we order to exclu de Thirdware from the 
final set of comparables.  
INFOBEANS TECHNOLOGIES LTD. (INFOBEANS)  
 44.    The taxpayer sought exclusion of Infobeans as a comparable again on 
ground of functional dissimilarity, it also being i nto providing services viz. 
software engineering services primarily in Custom A pplication Development 
(CAD), Content Management Systems, Enterprise Mobil ity, Big Data Analytics, 
UX & UI, Automation Engineering Services, as is evi dent from its financials, 
available on page 123 of the annual report paper bo ok.  
45.     The taxpayer also brought on record profile  of the Infobeans at pages 
58 to 60 of the appeal memo wherein it is claimed b y the Infobeans that it is 
providing wide range of services under four vertica ls i.e. services, automation, 
enterprise and industries and under the automation services verticals, the 
company is providing advanced robotic process autom ation services. SinceIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 33 of 61 
Infobeans is into diversified activities it cannot be a suitable comparable vis-
àvis the taxpayer which is a routine software devel opment services provider. 
Infobeans has been excluded as a comparable on acco unt of functional 
dissimilarity vis-à-vis routine software developmen t service provider by the 
coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in case of Pub Mat ic India (P.) Ltd. (supra). 
So, in view of the matter, we order to exclude Info beans from the final set of 
comparables.  
INTEQ SOFTWARE LTD. (INTEQ) 
 46.    The taxpayer sought exclusion of Inteq agai n on account of functional 
dissimilarity being into providing outsourced produ ct development services 
and Healthcare BPO services to its customers as per  website extracted at 
pages 83 to 85 of the appeal memo set. It being a p rivate limited company its 
financials are not available in the public domain. Its annual report made 
available at pages 848 to 909 of the annual reports  paper book does not 
provide segmental profitability earned from softwar e development services, 
outsourced product development services and Healthc are BPO services.  
47.     When we examine profit & loss account at pa ge 873 of the annual 
report paper book, software development and service  charges are shown in 
composite manner with no segmental profitability. I n these circumstances, 
we are of the considered view that Inteq is not a s uitable comparable vis-à-vis 
the taxpayer which is a routine software developmen t service provider 
working on cost-plus mark up model, hence ordered t o be excluded from the 
final set of comparables.  
17.     We note that the assessee in Global Logic I ndia Ltd. (supra) was a captive 
service provider to its AE for assessment year 2016 -17. Nothing has been placed by 
the Revenue to deviate from the above view taken by  the coordinate bench of this 
Tribunal in Global Logic India Ltd. (supra).  
18. Respectfully following the view taken by the co ordinate bench of this Tribunal in 
Global Logic India Ltd. (supra), we direct Ld. AO/T PO to exclude Inteq Software 
Pvt.Ltd, L&T Infotech Ltd., Infobean Technologies L td., Thirdware Solutions Ltd. from 
the final list of comparable for SWD segment.  
19. Persistent Systems Ltd . : It is submitted that this company is functional ly 
dissimilar to the assessee on various counts and th erefore deserves to be rejected. 
The Ld.AR submitted that, this comparable is functi onally not similar with that of 
assessee, as it is engaged in, rendering Enterprise  Digital Transformation, product 
engineering and solutioning for Internet of Things (IoT), product engineering and 
professional services to ISVs and enterprises, IP p roducts, services, development of 
software products and offers complete product life cycle services without there being

similar with that of assessee who is a captive serv ice provider to its AE. 
 20. Infosys Ltd.:  It is submitted that this company is functionally dissimilar to the 
assessee on various counts, and therefore, it ought  to be rejected from the final list of

to the above submissions by the Ld.AR. We of the vi ew that with such varied 
functions, these companies cannot be compared with assessee before us, which is a 
captive service provider. We accordingly direct the  Ld.AO/TPO to exclude Persistent 
Systems Ltd., and Infosys Ltd. from the final list.   
22. Aspire Systems (India) Pvt.  
         It is submitted that, this company is func tionally not comparable with the 
assessee as it earns income from power generation. The Ld.AR placed reliance on 
page 127 of Annual Report. The Ld.AR submitted that , the company owns significant 
intangibles in form of goodwill, customer contracts . He placed reliance on page 2077 
& 2087 of annual report paper book in support. It i s submitted that Applied

Pvt. Ltd. reported in TS-191-ITAT-2020(Bang)  
        On the contrary, the Ld.DR relied on the or ders passed by the authorities below.  
         We have perused the submissions of both si des in light of records placed before 
us. We note that this company earns its revenue fro m power generation and it has 
nothing to do with the rendering of software develo pment service. In fact, we note 
that this company is a full fledged entrepreneur in  the business of power generation 
and therefore is not comparable functionally with a  captive software service 
provider like assessee. Nothing is been placed by t he Revenue contrary to the above 
observation. We therefore respectfully following th e above view, direct the 
Ld.AO/TPO to exclude Aspire System India Pvt. Ltd. from the final list.  
23. Nihilent Technologies Limited   
          It is submitted that, this company is fun ctionally dissimilar to the assessee and 
therefore ought to be rejected from the final list of comparables. It is submitted that, 
services rendered by this company are wide in range  and diversified. The Ld.AR 
submitted that, the company is engaged in diversifi ed activities. It is submitted that, 
it renders services in the nature of consulting, so ftware development and product 
development, provision of business consulting in th e area of the enterprise 
transformation, change and performance management, digital transformation, 
business intelligence and data science services and  also providing related IT services. 
The Ld.AR submitted that, software-consulting servi ces include end-to-end solutions, 
onsite management and IT functions, and planning & system designing, which are in 
no way comparable to the captive software developme nt activities as provided by the 
assessee.  
         The Ld.AR further submitted that, this com pany has incurred significant 
expenses in foreign currency of 37.68%, 33.27% and 37.47% of its total expenditure 
during the FYs 2015-16, 2014-15 and 2013-14, respec tively, which suggests that is 
engaged in provision of onsite services. And that, during the FY relevant to 
assessment year under consideration, this company a cquired GNet Group LLC, a 
business intelligence and analytical company, and I ntellect Bizware Services Pvt. 
Ltd., specialising in ERP and enterprise innovation . The Ld.AR submitted that, these 
acquisitions are bound to have a significant impact  on the financials of the company. 
The Ld.AR thus submitted that, for all the above re asons this company cannot be 
considered to be comparable with. He relied on the decision of Hon’ble Mumbai 
Tribunal in case of Red Hat India Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT  (supra)  
       On the contrary, the Ld.DR relied on the ord ers passed by the authorities below.  
         We have perused the submissions of both si des in light of records placed before 
us.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 37 of 61 
          The assessee sought exclusion of Nihilent  on ground of its functional 
dissimilarity vis-à-vis assessee. We have examined the website information of 
Nihilent, made available by the assessee at page No . 405 of the paper book, 
wherein it is mentioned that it is engaged in provi ding advanced analytics, 
artificial intelligence, blockchain, business intel ligence, data science, cloud 
services etc.  
45.      Perusal of the disclosure of enterprise's reportable segment 
explanatory available at page No. A406 of the paper  book shows that Nihilent 
is engaged in software development and consultancy,  engineering services, 
web development and hosting and subsequently divers ified itself into the 
domain of business analytics and business process o utsourcing and financials 
of Nihilent available at page No. A304, A405-A406 o f the paper book shows 
that Page 33 of 51 IT(TP)A No. 235/Bang/2021 Nihile nt has only one 
business segment and in the absence of segmental fi nancials, as it is into 
diversified business, this company cannot be a vali d comparable vis-à-vis 
assessee, who is a low risk entity working on cost + markup model. Hence, 
Nihilent is ordered to be excluded as a comparable.  Nihilent Ltd.  
46.      The assessee sought exclusion of Nihilent Ltd. as a comparable on the 
ground that it is functionally dissimilar vis-à-vis  assessee. This objection was 
also raised before the Ld. DRP but rejected. The as sessee relied upon website 
of the company which is made available at page A 41 2 of the paper book 
wherein Nihilent Ltd. is shown to be engaged in pro viding advanced analytics, 
artificial intelligence, blockchain, business intel ligence, data signs, cloud 
services etc. The annual financials of this company  available at page A412 & 
A413 of the paper book shows that it is rendering E nterprise transformation 
and change management, Digital transformation servi ces and Enterprise IT 
services but segmental financials are not available  as is apparent from its 
financials available at page A305, A412 & A413 of t he paper book. When this 
company is into various segments but segmental fina ncials are not available 
it cannot be a valid comparable vis-à-vis assessee which is a routine software 
development service provider working on cost + mark up model, hence 
ordered to be excluded.  
       We note that the assessee in Red Hat India P vt. Ltd. v. ACIT (supra) was a captive 
service provider to its AE for assessment year 2016 - 17. Nothing has been placed by 
the Revenue to deviate from the above view taken by  the coordinate bench of this 
Tribunal in Red Hat India Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT (supra) . We are of the view that, based on 
the functions performed by this company as submitte d by the Ld.AR and the 
observations of Hon’ble Mumbai Tribunal, this compa rable deserves to be excluded 
from the final list. We therefore respectfully foll owing the above view, direct the 
Ld.AO/TPO to exclude Nihilent Technologies Ltd from  the final list.  
24.   Cybage Software Pvt.Ltd . 
        It is submitted that this company is engage d in the provision of diversified 
services which include product engineering, testing  & quality assurance services,IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021

engaged in product development and has developed a product called ‘excelshore’ 
apart from providing spectrum of services including  ITeS and BPO services and that 
segmental information of the diverse business funct ions undertaken by the company 
is not available.  
       The Ld.AR submitted that this company is mak ing super normal profits and that 
it is not reflective of the performance of the indu stry in which it operates.

       Reliance in this regard is placed on the dec ision of the Hon’ble Hyderabad 
Tribunal in Infor (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (supra) . On the contrary, the Ld.DR relied 
on the orders passed by the authorities below.  
We have perused the submissions of both sides in li ght of records placed before us.  
        Primarily we note that this company is a pr oduct company and has diversified 
business segments. We note that this company is a f ull fledged entrepreneur and 
assumes all the risks attributable to the various b usiness segments for which details 
are not available. In our view, under such circumst ances, this company cannot be 
held tobe functionally comparable with that of asse ssee which is a captive service 
provider that caters only to its AE.  
        Respectfully following the above view, we d irect the Ld.AO/TPO to exclude 
Cybage Software Pvt.Ltd., from the final list. 
 25. R.S Software (I) Pvt.Ltd :  
          It is submitted that, this company is eng aged in diversified activities, which are 
not similar to the services rendered by the assesse e. The company is into custom 
application development, quality assurance and test ing, application maintenance 
and support, strategic consulting, in respect of wh ich, segmental details are 
unavailable. The company is engaged in development of platform services and is 
rendering data analytics services, which are differ ent from the routine SWD services 
rendered by the assessee. The data analytics servic es rendered by the company will 
fall within the definition of KPO services, which a re incomparable to the services 
rendered by the assessee.  
            It is submitted that this company condu cts research and development work in 
the areas of real time analytics, MDM, proximity, p ayments, digital commerce, 
mobile payments, testing, automation, personalised loyalty in payments and 
merchant management in payments laboratory. 
           On the contrary, the Ld.DR relied on the  orders passed by the authorities 
below.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 39 of 61 
          We have perused the submissions of both s ides in light of records placed before 
us.  
          We note that this company is a full fledg ed entrepreneur and assumes all the 
risks attributable to the various business segments  for which details are not 
available. In our view, under such circumstances, t his company cannot be held to be 
functionally comparable with that of assessee which  is a captive service provider 
that caters only to its AE.  
       We therefore direct the Ld.AO/TPO to exclude  R.S Software (I) Pvt.Ltd, from the 
final list.  
Accordingly this ground raised by the assesse stand s allowed. 
4.1     Respectfully following the judgment of  co-o rdinate bench of 
the Tribunal cited supra all the above ten companie s noted supra are 
to be excluded for computation of ALP in the final s et of comparables. 
Accordingly this ground No. 3.8raised by the assessee  stands allowed 
in above terms . 
Ground No. 3.9:   
5. Vide this ground, the Appellant is seeking the inc lusion of 
Akshay Software Technologies Ltd.  (‘Akshay’) and Sasken 
Communication Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (‘Sasken’)  even though the 
company is functionally comparable. 
 
5.1 In regards to Akshay Software Technologies Ltd, it is 
submitted that the TPO rejected this company on the g round that it is 
functionally different from the Appellant. The DRP u pheld its rejection 
on the ground that the company did not feature in the  search matrix of 
the TPO which is incorrect.  
5.2 In this regard, the ld, AR submitted that a peru sal of the 
functions of the company listed in its annual report  shows that theIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 40 of 61 
company is functionally similar to the Appellant. T he website of the 
company states that the company is engaged in render ing IT services, 
which are in the nature of SWD. Further, it is subm itted that the 
income from SWD services is 96.5% of total sales an d the income from 
sale of software licenses constitutes a meagre 3.4%  of the total 
revenue and therefore the same would not have any imp act on the 
profitability of the company. Further the company p asses all the filters 
applied by the TPO. Details submissions in this rega rd are placed at 
pages 131-133 and 526-529 of the paperbook. Relianc e is placed on 
the decisions of this Hon’ble Tribunal in the Appell ant’s own case for

(order dated 30.08.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 235/Ban g/2021) for 
AY 2016-17, where in the company came to be remanded.   
5.3 In  regard to  Sasken Communication Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  
the TPO rejected the company on the ground that the segmental 
details are unavailable. The DRP upheld its rejection  on the ground 
that the company did not feature in the search matrix  of the TPO. The 
ld, AR submitted that the segmental details of the co mpany are 
available and furnished before the lower authorities (refer page 134 of 
the paperbook). Further, it is submitted that the co mpany is 
functionally comparable to the Appellant and passes all the filters 
applied by the TPO. Submissions in this regard are pl aced at pages 
134-136 and 533-539 of the paperbook. Reliance is p laced on the 
decisions of this Hon’ble Tribunal in the Appellant’ s own case for the 
AY 2014-15 and in Arm Embedded Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT  
(order dated 30.08.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 235/Ban g/2021) for

company was included. 
6. The ld. DR. relied on the order of the lower author ities. 
7. Considering the rival submissions, both the compa nies have 
been considered by the co-ordinate bench of the Tribun al in the case 
of Arm Embedded Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT( TP)A No. 
235/Bang/2021 order dated 30.08.2022 in which these c omparable 
companies have been sent back to the AO/TPO for a f resh 
consideration by observing as under:- 
 26. Ground No. 2.11: That the Ld.TPO erred in exclu ding Akshay Software 
Technologies Ltd, Sasken Communication Technologies  Ltd. and Evoke Technologies 
Pvt. Ltd., even though the same are functionally co mparable to the assessee.  
          It is submitted that this company is enga ged in providing software development 
services. It is submitted that these comparables we re not considered by the Ld.TPO 
as they did not appear in the search matrix carried  out by him, which has been 
upheld by the DRP. He placed reliance on the decisi ons of coordinate bench of this 
Hon’ble Tribunal in the case of Prism Networks Pvt.  Ltd. reported in (2022) 141 
taxmann.com 163.  
        On the contrary, the Ld.DR relied on the or ders passed by the authorities below.  
         We have perused the submissions of both si des in light of records placed before 
us. 
         We note that this Tribunal in case of Pris m Networks Pvt. Ltd.(supra) observed 
and held as under:  
18.    We heard the rival submissions. It is clear from the order of the DRP that the 
DRP has not considered the plea of the Assessee in proper perspective. The fact that 
the TPO rejected the TP study of the Assessee canno t be the basis not to consider the 
claim of the Assessee for inclusion of comparable c ompanies. The TPO excluded these 
companies only on the ground that information relat ed to these companies was not 
available in the public domain and this fact was sh own to be an incorrect 
assumption by the Assessee in the submissions befor e the DRP. In such circumstances, 
it was incumbent on the part of the DRP to have adj udicated the question of 
inclusion of these companies as comparable companie s. The fact that theseIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 42 of 61 
companies do not figure in the search matrix of the  TPO is not and cannot be a 
ground not to consider inclusion of these companies  as comparable companies. Since 
the DRP has failed to do so, we are of the view tha t the issue regarding inclusion of 
the aforesaid companies as comparable companies sho uld be set aside to AO/TPO for 
fresh consideration in the light of the information  available in public domain. Thus 
ground No. 7 is treated as allowed for statistical purposes.  
          Respectfully following the above view, we  remit the comparables back o the 
Ld.AO/TPO for fresh consideration in the light of i nformation available in public 
domain. Accordingly this ground stands allowed for statistical purposes. 
7.1 Respectfully following the above view, we remit  the comparable 
back to the Ld.AO/TPO for fresh consideration in the light of 
information available in public domain in above term s. Accordingly 
this ground No, 3.9 stands allowed for statistical pur poses 
Ground No.4 :   
8. Vide this ground, the Appellant is seeking the re-
computation of margins of CG-VAK Software & Exports  Ltd. and 
Kals Information Systems Pvt. Ltd. Further, without prejudice to 
the above submissions, the margins of Inteq Softwar e Pvt. Ltd, and 
Aspire Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd. also ought to be rec tified.  
- CG VAK: It is submitted that the correct weighted ave rage 
margin of the company is 12.03% and not 18.50% as

recorded by the ld. DRP we also giving direction to th e AO/TPO for 
computation of correct margin in the line of the di rection given  by the 
Ld. DRP. Accordingly this ground is allowed for stati stical purpose.  
ITeS SEGMENT  
Ground No. 3.10  –  
10. The assessee raised issue that the TPO erred in  including Tech 
Mahindra Business Services Ltd., Infosys BPM Ltd., S PI Technologies 
India Pvt. Ltd., and Eclerx Services Ltd. which ought to be excluded 
from the final list of comparable as the companies are functionally 
dissimilar to the Appellant . In this regard the appe llant has submitted 
as under:- 
a)  Infosys BPM Ltd. (‘Infosys BPO’)–  
Functionally different: 
Infosys BPO provides integrated IT and end-to-end b usiness process outsourcing 
solutions across a variety of verticals and horizon tals. The company caters to 
industry segment comprising of customers relating t o financial services and 
insurance (FSI), manufacturing (MFG), enterprises i n energy, utilities and 
telecommunication services (ECS) and retail, logist ics, consumer product group, life 
sciences and health care enterprises (RCL). The hor izontals solutions comprise of

(Industry) solutions include FSI (Financial Service s & Insurance), MFG 
(Manufacturing), ECS (Energy, Utilities, Communicat ion and Services) and RCL 
(Retail, Consumer packaged goods, Logistics and Lif e Sciences). These services 
cannot be compared to the routine back-office servi ces provided by the Appellant.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 44 of 61 
The company focuses of delivering solutions to its clients which goes beyond 
rendering routine ITe services. From the above, it is evident that Infosys BPO is 
engaged in rendering business solutions and consult ancy to its customers which is 
different from the Appellant’s functional profile. 
Brand value: 
Infosys BPO enjoys huge brand value and has also ma de significant investments 
in creating intangibles and owns significant intang ible assets. In view of its 
substantial brand value, the company enjoys an adva ntage in the market and has 
high bargaining power. As a result of the brand val ue, the company receives a 
premium in the market. 
Outsourcing costs: 
Further, the company has incurred significant expen ses towards subcontracting 
charges, which demonstrates that the business model  followed by the company is 
different from that of the Appellant. It is, theref ore, submitted that Infosys BPO is not 
comparable to the Appellant.  
Significant related party transactions: 
The company entered into related party transactions  of exceeding 15% i.e. 
18.42% over sales during FY 2013-14, 20.88% during the FY 2014-15, 20.42% 
during the FY 2015-16. Therefore the company ought to be excluded from the final 
list of comparables.  
Submissions in this regard are placed at pages 142- 151 and 570-583 of the 
paperbook.  
It is submitted that this company is consistently e xcluded from the final list 
of comparables in cases of similarly placed assesse es. Reliance is placed on the 
decisions of this Hon’ble Tribunal in the Appellant ’s own case for the AY 2014-15 
and in NTT Data Information Processing Services Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (order 
dated 07.07.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 297/Bang/202 1) for AY 2016-17. 
Further reliance is placed on the order dated 03.01 .2018 of the Hon’ble High 
Court of Delhi in PCIT v. H & S Software Development and Knowledge 
Management Centre Pvt. Ltd . (ITA No.912/2017 at internal page 2 of the 
order) upholding its exclusion, and on decision of the Hyderabad Bench of this 
Hon’ble Tribunal in ADP Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (order dated 03.02.2022 passed in ITA 
Nos. 227&228/Hyd/2021). 
Thus, Infosys BPO is liable to be excluded from the  list of comparables. 
b)  Eclerx Services Ltd.(‘Eclerx’) –  
Functionally different: 
       It is submitted that the company ought to be  excluded as it is engaged in 
providing high end Knowledge Process Outsourcing se rvices, which cannot be 
compared to routine ITeS rendered by the Appellant.  The company provides dataIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021

comparable to the services rendered by the Appellan t.  
Significant intangibles: 
The company is engaged in developing its own intang ible assets. During the 
assessment year under consideration, the company ha s recognized as amount of Rs. 
56.31 million as ‘computer software’.  
Peculiar economic circumstances: 
During the year under consideration, the company ac quired a European based 
company which significantly contributed to its cust omers and revenue base. It is 
submitted that this acquisition is a peculiar econo mic circumstance, which is bound 
to have an impact on the margin of the company. In the absence of any reasonably 
accurate adjustments capable of being made to mitig ate the impact, the company 
ought to be excluded from the final list of compara ble.  
Abnormal profits:  
The company has shown abnormal growth patterns from  FY 2005-06 to FY 2014-
15, and has grown inorganically. The operating prof it of the company during the 
aforesaid years fluctuates between 41 crores to 408  crores, demonstrating that the 
company is growing rather inorganically and therefo re cannot be selected as a 
comparable.  
Significant related party transactions: 
The company had related party transactions (expense s) of 27.80% of total 
operating expenses during the FY 2013-14, 27.18% du ring the FY 2014-15, 23.26% 
during the FY 2015-16.  
Submissions in this regard are placed at pages 151- 163 and 593-610 of the 
paperbook.  
It is submitted that this company is consistently e xcluded from the final list 
of comparables in cases of similarly placed assesse es. Reliance is placed on the 
decisions of this Hon’ble Tribunal in the Appellant ’s own case for the AY 2014-15 
and in NTT Data Information Processing Services Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (order 
dated 07.07.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 297/Bang/202 1) for AY 2016-17. 
Further reliance is placed on the decisions of the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay 
in PCIT v. PTC Software (I) (P.) Ltd.  (reported in [2019] 101 taxmann.com 117 
(Bombay)) and PCIT v. BNY Mellon International Operations (India)  (P.)

Hyderabad Bench of this Hon’ble Tribunal in ADP Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (order dated 
03.02.2022 passed in ITA Nos. 227&228/Hyd/2021). In  view of the above, it is

Infosys BPO Ltd. at para 7.4.1 and held as under : 
7.  Infosys BPO Ltd., ('Infosys') 
7.1  This company 'Infosys' was selected as a comparabl e company by the 
TPO. The assessee objected to its inclusion both be fore the TPO as 
well as the DRP, but both the authorities below rej ected the assessee's 
objections to its inclusion. 
7.2.1  Before us, the assessee objected to the inclusion of this company, 
'Infosys' on the following grounds:— 
I Functionally Different 
  It is engaged in diversified activities and provide s services 
in the area of Analytics, Legal process outsourcing , 
etc., unlike the assessee in the case on hand which  
provides low end ITES. 
   It provides business process management services, 
consultancy and management services and end -to -IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 47 of 61 
end outsourcing, as can be seen from pages 5, 14 an d 
33 of its Annual Report. 
  It is engaged in research and development. 
II Ownership of intangible assets 
This company, Infosys, owns intangible assets worth  Rs. 19 Crores during 
the year as can be seen from pages 16, 47 and 58 of  its Annual 
Report; whereas the assessee does not possess any i ntangible asset. 
III Brand Value 
'Infosys' has brand value; having incurred Rs. 5 Cr ores for its brand 
building and advertisement, as can be seen from pag es 24, 29, 47, 58 
and 64 of its Annual Report; whereas the assessee d oes not have any 
brand. 
IV Sub-contracting 
Infosys operates on a different business model as i t has incurred Rs. 157 
Crores towards cost of technical sub-contractors. 
7.2.2  In support of the assessee's contentions, the lear ned AR submitted 
and took us through the relevant pages of the Annua l Report of 
'Infosys'. It was submitted that for the reasons gi ven above, it has 
been consistently held by various benches of the Tr ibunal over the 
years that this company cannot be considered as a c omparable to 
companies leading ITES. In this regard, the learned  AR placed 
reliance on the following decisions:— 
   CGI Information Systems & Management Consultants (P .) 
Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT [2018] 94 taxmann.com 97 (Bang. -  
Trib.) . 
  Mobily Infotech India (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2018] 97 
taxmann.com 2 (Bang. - Trib.) . 
7.3  Per contra, the learned DR for Revenue supported t he orders of the 
authorities below. 
7.4.1  We have considered the rival contentions/submissio ns and perused 
the material on record; including the judicial deci sions cited. We find 
from a perusal of the Annual Report at page 14 ther eof, under the 
head 'Managements Discussion and Analysis', it has been stated that 
this company provides services to both horizontal a nd vertical focus 
areas. The Horizontal focus areas are Sourcing and Procurement (S & 
P), Customer Services (CS), Finance and Accounting (F & A), Legal 
Process Outsourcing (LPO), Sales and Fulfillment (S  & F), Analytics 
(AT), Business Platform (BP), Business Transformati on Services 
(BTS), Human Resources Outsourcing (HRO) and Techno logy 
Solution Optimization (TSO). The Vertical focus are as of services are 
Financial Services & Insurance (FSI) Manufacturing (MFG), Energy, 
Utilities Communication & Services (ECS) and Retail , Consumer 
Packaged Foods, Logistics & Life Services (RCL). Fr om the above, it is 
clear that 'Infosys' offers a gamut of different an d diversified servicesIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 48 of 61 
which cannot be compared with routine back office s ervices provided 
by the assessee. In fact, it is mentioned at page 1 4 of the Annual 
Report that the company 'Infosys' provides business  process 
management services which are different from routin e back office 
services. It is also seen that this company enjoys significant brand 
value and owns intangible assets which clearly esta blish that Infosys 
is different from the assessee in the case on hand.  
7.4.1  We also further observe that this company, 'Infosy s' has 
consistently been rejected as a comparable to compa nies rendering 
routine back office services in various judicial pr onouncements of the 
Tribunal; including the two decisions cited by the assessee (supra). In 
the case of CGI Informaiton Systems & Management Co nsultants (P.) 
Ltd. (supra) cited by the assessee, this company 'I nfosys' has been 
excluded from the list of comparables for the reaso n that it has brand 
value which had an impact on its pricing and margin s. As the facts of 
the year under consideration are similar, the decis ion rendered in the 
earlier year would apply to the year under consider ation as well. In 
this factual view of the matter, we hold that Infos ys BPO Ltd., stands 
on a totally different footing from a company engag ed in rendering 
routine back office ITES; being both functionally d ifferent and having 
brand value and therefore is to be excluded from th e final set of 
comparables. We hold and direct accordingly. 
(ii)  E-Clerx Services Limited has a margin of 70.26% and  engaged in both 
rendering KPO and BPO services and no segmental inf ormation is 
available and the company has acquired entire share  holding of 
Agilyst Inc. The company was excluded for the Asses sment Year 2014-
15 in the case of Hyundai Motor India Engineering P vt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT 
109 taxmann.com 429 at para 32 which read as under :  
32.  Thus, on a comparison of the functions of the asse ssee and other companies 
reproduced above, we find that E-Clerx Ltd is not o nly into ITeS services, but is 
also rendering KPO services and therefore, it canno t be compared to the 
assessee. In the decisions of the ITAT where it has  been held to be a comparable 
to the assessee, we find that ITAT has held that th e services provided by the 
assessee company and E-Clerx Ltd are similar and th at the extra-ordinary event 
of winding up of the subsidiary company has not bee n proved to have any 
bearing on the assessee's profits and that super no rmal profit may not be a basis 
for exclusion of this company. However, we find tha t the Coordinate Benches of 
the Tribunal nor the Revenue Officers have not brou ght out functions which are 
similar to both the companies. The decision of the ITAT for year AY 2011-12 was 
followed in the AY 2012-13. Therefore, we are of th e opinion that these decisions 
cannot exactly be binding on this Tribunal for the relevant AY, where the 
AO/TPO have considered the assessee as an ITeS serv ice provider and not as a 
KPO. Further, as pointed out by the ld Counsel for the assessee, The TPO has 
himself has not taken E-Clerx Ltd as a comparable f or the AY 2013-14. 
Therefore, we direct the TPO/AO to exclude this com pany from the final list of 
comparables to the assessee.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 49 of 61 
We found the decision of the co-ordinate Bench of T ribunal where the said 
comparable is in KPO services and accordingly we di rect the TPO to exclude 
the comparable from the final list of comparables f or determination of ALP. 
Respectfully following the decision of the co-ordin ate bench of the Tribunal we 
direct to the AO/TPO for exclusion of these two com panies from the- list of the 
comparable.  
12.1 We find the judicial decisions, applicable for t he Assessment 
Year 2014-15 and based on the observations of the co -ordinate 
Bench, we consider the company Infosys BPO Limited & E-Clerx 
Services Ltd. comparable has to be excluded and accordin gly direct 
the TPO to exclude this company form the final list of comparable. 
 
c)  SPI Technologies India Pvt. Ltd. (‘SPI Technologies’) –  
Functionally different: 
13. The ld. AR. submitted that this company is funct ionally not 
comparable to the Appellant. The company is engaged  in data 
processing and related services, primarily in the ty pesetting business, 
including transformation of unedited manuscripts int o final print-
ready files, supply of structured data for electronic publishing and 
providing end to end project management services. T he services of the 
company as described on the website are content solu tions data 
processing, customer relationship management, KPO s ervices, etc., 
which are not entirely comparable to the services o f the Appellant. 
Segmental details as regards the varied services render ed by the 
company are not available, and therefore the company  ought to be 
excluded from the final list of comparables.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 50 of 61 
Peculiar economic circumstances: 
13.1  Further, during the FY 2014-15, the Hon’ble M adras High 
Court passed the order confirming the amalgamation of  SPI 
Technologies India Private Limited and Laserwords Pri vate Limited, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of SPI Technologies. This con stitutes a 
peculiar economic circumstance which has an impact on the margin of 
the company, in respect of which no reasonably accu rate adjustments 
can be made to mitigate such impact.  
Abnormal growth patterns: 
13.2 It is also submitted that the company had abnorm al growth 
patterns - during FY 2015-16 32.97% and during the FY 2014-15 
66.64%, which is not in line with the average indust ry growth rate of 
11-12%.  
Substantial intangibles: 
13.3 The company owned intangibles representing 27.1 1% of the 
total fixed assets for the FY 2015-16, 10.16% in th e FY 2014-15 and 
11.56% in the FY 2013-14.  
Related party transactions: 
13.4 The company entered into substantial related par ty transactions 
exceeding 15% i.e. 16.46% during the FY 2014-15 and 1 7.03% during 
the FY 2015-16.  
Submissions in this regard are placed at pages 151-15 4 and 584-
592 of the paper book.  
13.5 Reliance is placed on the decision of this Hon’ ble Tribunal in 
NTT Data Information Processing Services Pvt. Ltd. v.  DCIT (orderIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 51 of 61 
dated 07.07.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 297/Bang/2021) for AY 
2016-17. 
In view of the above, SPI Technologies is liable to  be excluded 
from the list of comparables. 
 
14. The ld. DR relied on the order of the lower autho rities. 
 
15. Considering the rival submissions we noted that t he co-ordinate 
bench has excluded this company in the case of NTT Data 
Information Processing Services Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (order dated 
07.07.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 297/Bang/2021) for  AY 2016-
17.The relevant part of the order is as under:- 
(c) SPI Technologies India Pvt. Ltd. 
Functionally dissimilar 
9.  As per the annual report of the company, the compa ny is engaged in 
typesetting business, including transformation of u nedited manuscripts 
into final print-ready files, supply of structured data for electronic 
publishing and providing end-to-end project managem ent services. 
These services are not comparable to the services r endered by the 
Assessee. 
9.1  Further, the learned TPO in the order has rejected  MPS Limited which 
is engaged in "the business of providing publishing  solutions viz., type 
setting and data digitization services for overseas  publishers and supports 
international publishers through every stage of the  author-to-reader 
publishing process and provides a digital-first str ategy for publishers 
across content production, enhancement and transfor mation, delivery 
and customer support. 
MPS Limited has been rejected basis functional inco mparability. 
KPO service company basis response received u/s 133 (6) 
9.2  Basis the response received u/s 133(6) of the Act from SPI 
Technologies, the company has claimed that it is "o perating in knowledge 
process outsourcing..". Considering that SPI techno logy provides 
KPO services, the same is uncomparable to the Asses see's business of 
routine BPO services. 
Sub-contracting cost 
9.3  The company incurs subcontracting charges which in dicates it 
outsources part of its activity. The cost of such s ubcontracting charges isIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 52 of 61 
INR 20.88 crores for FY 2015-16 hence, SPI's busine ss model is different 
from NTT Data IPS as it does not outsource its work . 
Presence of inventories 
9.4  SPI has inventories for INR 68.69 crores (which wo rks out as 20.43% 
of turnover) in its Balance Sheet unlike the Assess ee that is a 
pure service provider with no inventories. 
Judicial precedents relied upon: 
High-end KPO service uncomparable- 
Rampgreen Solutions (P.) Ltd. (supra) 
10.  The Ld. D.R. submitted that for functional differe nces, the assessee has 
relied on the website extract of this company. The discussion on the 
comparability should be based on the Annual Report of the company for 
the relevant financial year. As For example, in the  present case, we are 
considering the Annual Report of 2015-16 whereas wh en the submission 
is made by the assessee before the TPO in FY 2019-2 0, the web site extract 
will show the functionality of the company in the r elevant financial 
year i.e., 19-20 which may be much different than t he FY 15-16 which is 
actually under consideration. Having said that, the  functionality of the 
company is analysed with reference to the annual re port for F.Y. 2015-16. 
It is reported in page Nos. 119 &120 of the annual report that "the 
company is engaged in data processing and related s ervices primarily in 
the typesetting business, including transformation of unedited 
manuscripts into final print ready files, supply of  structured (data for 
electronic publishing and providing end-to-end proj ect 
management services", all these activities are in t he nature of ITeS and 
hence, is held to be functionally comparable. Furth er, the company is in 
single segment of ITeS as per ITC 4 digit code repo rted in the Annual 
Report at page no. 1. Accordingly, the company is F unctionally 
comparable. 
10.1  The assessee contended based on the information co llected under 
section 133(6) of. the Act by the TPO that this com pany is involved in 
provision of diversified KPO services and hence can not he considered as 
ITES comparable. There is a thin line of difference  between BPO and 
KPO services. KPO is termed as an upward shift of. the BPO industry in the 
value chain. Thus, BPO trying to upgrade itself as KPO is likely to render 
both BPO as well as KPO services in the process of evolution and therefore, 
such an entity cannot be considered strictly as eit her BPO or KPO. In view 
of the above, ITeS services cannot be further class ified as BPO and 
KPO services for the purpose of comparability analy sis. Under the TNMM, 
functional similarity is more relevant than product  similarity. 
10.2  As discussed by the TPO, the company in response t o the notice u/s 
133. (6) of the Act, has stated that the company an d Lambda tent Pvt 1,1d 
had entered into a scheme of amalgamation with effe ct from 1 September 
2017. This amalgamation also does not pertain to th is year and do not 
have any impact on the profits of the company. 
10.3  The company is engaged in providing, only data 
processing services and hence the margin is complet ely at the entity level.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 53 of 61 
On page 163 of the Annual report, the company has, disclosed that the 
entire revenue is from data processing and related services only. 
10.4  Therefore, all these objections are to be rejected  and this company is 
to be a comparable. 
11.  We have heard the rival submissions and perused th e materials 
available on record. The main contention of the Ld.  A.R. is that TPO 
rejected the NPS Ltd. which is engaged in the busin ess of providing 
publishing solutions namely typesetting, data digit isation commission for 
overseas publisher and support international publis her through every 
stage of the author to reader publishing process an d provides the digital 
first strategy for publishing contents, production and transformation, 
delivery and customer support. Thus, NPS Ltd. Has b een rejected based on 
functional incomparability. Hence, on the same logi c SPI 
Technologies Ltd. to be excluded. 
 
15.1 Respectfully following the above judgement we also 
direct to the AO/TPO for exclusion of SPI Technologies Ltd. 
From the final list of the comparables. 
 
d)  Tech Mahindra Business Services Ltd. (‘Tech Mahindra’) – 
Functionally different: 
16. The ld. AR submitted that Tech Mahindra is a Busi ness Process 
Outsourcing service provider delivering high end diver sified support 
services across various industries, unlike the Appe llant which is 
engaged in rendering captive ITeS to its AE. Further,  segmental details 
as regards the varied services are unavailable.  
16.1 The company owns significant intangibles  16% during the FY 
2015-16 and 32% during the FY 2014-15, as opposed to the Appellant 
which has marginal intangible assets.  
Significant expenses in foreign currency: 
16.2 Further, considering its expenses in foreign cu rrency towards 
onsite operations, it is evident that Tech Mahindra has a differentIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 54 of 61 
business model, wherein the delivery of the services is undertaken 
from its Indian as well as overseas offices. 
Peculiar economic circumstances: 
16.3 During the FY 2014-15, Tech Mahindra had starte d operations in 
Waterford, Ireland. It is submitted that Tech Mahindra  was involved in 
extraordinary events of amalgamation and acquisition  in one of the 
years under consideration i.e., FY 2014-15 and as a re sult, the 
company reaps benefits of the acquired company whic h in-turn leads 
to higher revenue and profits. It is submitted that t his acquisition is 
likely to have a material impact on the margin of t he company, in 
respect of which no reasonably accurate adjustments  can be made to 
mitigate the impact thereof.  
16.4 The detailed submissions are placed at pages 139 -142 and 550-
556 of the paper book, which is placed on record. Th us, Tech Mahindra 
is liable to be excluded from the list of comparable s. 
17. The Ld. DR relied on the order of the lower author ities. 
 
18. Since the assessee has relied in the judgment of co-ordinate 
bench in the case of NTT Data Information Processing Services Pvt. 
Ltd. v. DCIT (order dated 07.07.2022 passed in IT(TP)A No. 
297/Bang/2021) for AY 2016-17 which is engaged in th e  ITeS and SPI  
Technologies Ltd  has not been considered as compara ble company 
whereas TechMahindra Business Services Ltd . has been 
considered comparable company at para No. 20 it is observed as 
under:-IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 55 of 61 
20. On acceptance of the afore-mentioned submission s, the final list of 
comparables would be as follows : 
(a)    Bhilwara Infotechnology Limited  
(b)    One touch Solutions India Private Limited  
(c)    TechMahindraBusinessServicesLtd. 
(d)    Hartron Communications Limited 
(e)    Ace Software Exports Ltd 
(f)    Sundaram BusinessServices Limited 
(g)    Informed Technologies India Limited 
(h)    B N R Udyog Ltd 
 
20.1  Since the Assessee's margin would be within the ar m's length range of 
remaining comparables, the international transactio n of provision of IT 
enabled services by the Assessee to its AEs would b e at arm's length. 
 
20.2  The argument of Ld. D.R. is that the assessee has not produced the physical 
copy of annual report and hence it has not been con sidered by the lower 
authorities. 
 
20.3  We have heard the rival submissions and perused th e materials available 
on record. In our opinion, if all the filters are s atisfied, these comparables to be 
included. Accordingly, this issue is remitted back to the file of the AO/TPO with a 
direction to the assessee to furnish the copy of th e annual report and if 
furnished, the AO/TPO to apply the filters at segme ntal level to decide 
accordingly. Accordingly, these comparables are rem itted to file of AO/TPO for 
fresh consideration 
 
18.1 Respectfully following the above judgment, we a re remitting 
Tech Mahindra Business Services Ltd ., to the file of ld.AO/TPO to 
consider in the above terms cited in para No.18 in th e case of NTT 
Data Information Processing Services Pvt. Ltd. v. DCI T .IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 56 of 61 
18.2 To sum up the Ground No. 3.10 is partly allowed for 
statistical purpose,  
 
 
Ground No. 3.11: 
19. In this   ground, the assessee  seeks  inclusion of Microgene tic 
Systems Ltd., Ace BPO Services Pvt. Ltd, and Suprawi n 
Technologies Ltd.  
Microgenetic Systems Ltd.  - 
19.1 The ld. AR submitted that the ld.TPO rejected thi s company for 
the reason that the financial data is not available in the public domain. 
The DRP upheld its exclusion on the basis that the c ompany filed the 
different FY filter and that its data was not availabl e.  
19.2 As regards non-availability of data , it is submitted that as per 
Rule 10B(5)(i) of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 read wi th second 
proviso to Rule 10CA(2), in case of a comparable co mpany for which 
data relating to the current year is unavailable, th en for the purpose of 
comparability analysis, the data for the immediately preceding two 
financial years preceding to the current year shall  be adopted for the 
purpose of comparability. Accordingly, the data for AY 2015-16 and AY 
2014-15 of Microgenetics ought to be considered for its comparability 
study. Further, as regards the DRP’s finding that the  company files the 
different FY ending filter, it is submitted that the f inding is erroneous 
in as much as the company follows the year ending on  31 st  March.  
19.3 The assessee submits that Microgenetic is enga ged in providing 
ITeS which are in the nature of medical transcripti on services. TheIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 57 of 61 
said services would fall under the category of ITeS a nd, therefore, it is 
submitted that Microgenetic is comparable to the fun ctional profile of 
ITeS rendered by the assessee.  
19.4 Submissions in this regard are placed at pages nos.164-166 and 
650-654 of the paper book. It is submitted that the company qualifies 
all the quantitative filters applied by the TPO.  
19.5 Pertinently, this company was included in the fi nal list of 
comparables by the TPO in the Assessee’s own case f or the AY 2014-
15.  
19.6 In view of the above, the company ought to be included in 
the final list of comparables.  
 
Ace BPO Services Pvt. Ltd: 
20. The ld. AR submitted that the company was excluded by the 
TPO on the ground that it is suffering from persist ent losses. The 
DRP upheld the company’s exclusion on the ground tha t it was not 
possible to ascertain the functions performed by th e company.  
 
20.1 In this regard, it is submitted that the margin  of the company 
for the 3 financial years under consideration are as  under: 
 
FY 2013-14: 0.95%,  
FY 2014-15: 1.99%,  
FY 2015-16: -0.27%.  
 
20.2 It is clear that the company is not making per sistent losses.IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 58 of 61 
 
20.3 As regards its functional comparability, it is submitted that 
the company is rendering health care, call centre, management 
service and transcription, which are in the nature o f ITeS. Under 
the healthcare services, the company provides insura nce eligibility, 
demographics, medical coding, charge posting, quality  audits, 
claims transmission, payment posting, accounts rece ivables 
analysis, collection follow up and monthly reconcil iation 
statement. Under the call centre services, the compa ny renders 
insurance coverage verification, benefits verificat ion, insurance 
follow ups, denials management, credit balance resol ution, 
appointment scheduling etc. Under management servic es, the 
company provides collection services, trend analysis  and process 
improvement. All the services rendered by the compan ies are 
comparable to the services rendered by the assessee. Further, the 
company passes all the filters applied by the TPO.  
 
20.4 Submissions in this regard are placed at pages 1 67-170 and 
655-659 of the paper book.  Reliance in this regard  is placed on the 
decision of the Hyderabad Bench of the Hon’ble Tribuna l in Infor 
(India) Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT  (order dated 06.10.2021 passed by this 
Hon’ble Tribunal in IT(TP)A No. 198/HYD/2021). Ther efore the 
company ought to be included in the final list of com parables.  
Suprawin Technologies Ltd.:  
 
20.5 The ld. AR submitted that this company was reje cted by the 
TPO on the ground that it is functionally dissimilar . The DRPIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021 
 
 
Page 59 of 61 
upheld its inclusion on the ground that the company did not 
feature in the search matrix of the TPO, which is i ncorrect.  
 
20.6 In this regard, it is submitted that the company  is rendering 
business process outsourcing services, which are si milar to the 
services rendered by the assessee. Further, the compa ny passes all 
the filters applied by the TPO. Submissions in this regard are 
placed at pages 663-666 of the paper book. Therefor e the company 
ought to be included in the final list of comparable s.  
 
21. The ld. DR relied on the order of the lower autho rities. 
 
22. Considering the submission of the assessee, we r emit the 
comparables back to the Ld.AO/TPO as sought by the a ssesee for 
inclusion and fresh consideration in the light of inf ormation available 
in public domain in above terms. Accordingly, this g round No.3.11 
stands allowed for statistical purposes. 
Ground No. 5 :  
23. The ld. AR of the assessee  submitted that during  the year 
under consideration, the assessee made various donatio ns 
amounting to           Rs.99,93,586/-, which was el igible for 
deduction under Section 80G of the Act. Accordingly, the assessee 
claimed  deduction of Rs. 54,16,090/-.  
23.1 During the course of assessment proceedings, th e assessee 
filed its submissions along with the details of the donations in 
respect of which, it had claimed the deduction. The det ails are 
placed at pages 713-739 of the paper book, which is placed onIT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2021

record. However, the Assessing Officer did not allow the same 
while computing the total income without any reason . It is 
submitted that the deduction was rightly claimed by th e assessee 
and ought to be allowed.  
23.2 In this regard, we direct to the AO for giving deduction after 
verifying the documents as per law. Accordingly, thi s ground is 
allowed for statistical purpose. 
23.3  We have decided only those grounds which were argued by 
the ld.AR of the assessee. 
24. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is pa rtly allowed for
