vkns'k@ ORDER 
 
PER: SANDEEP GOSAIN, JM  
This appeal of the assessee is  directed against the order of the ld. CIT(A), 
Kota dated 02-01-2015 for the assessment year 2010-11 raising therein following 
grounds of appeal. 
1. The impugned additions and disallowances made in the 
order dated 20-03-2013 u/s 143(3) of the Act, bad in law and on facts 
of the case, for want of jurisdiction and various other reasons and 
hence, the same kindly be deleted. 
 
2. Rs. 10,83,901/-:The ld. CIT(A) erred in law as well as on 
the facts of the case in confirming the disallowance of Rs.10,83,901/-2

3. Rs.7,236/-: The ld. CIT(A) erred in law as well as on the 
facts of the case in confirming the disallowance of Rs.7,236/- out of 
interest payment on account of alleged notional interest on interest 
free advances. The disallowance so made and confirmed by the ld. 
CIT(A), is contrary to the provision of law and hence, kindly be 
deleted in full. 
 
4. Rs.76,60,166/-: The ld. CIT(A) erred in law as well as on

funds were used on capital expenditure. The disallowance so made 
and confirmed by the ld. CIT(A) is contrary to the provision of law 
and hence, kindly be deleted in full. 
 
5. Rs.15,60,000/-: The ld. CIT(A) erred in law as well as on 
the facts of the case in confirming the disallowance of Rs.15,60,000/- 
being the amount of outstaying liability on account of scholarship 
expenses alleging that the same was a contingent/unascertainable  
liability not arising in the subjected year. The disallowance so made 
and confirmed by the ld. CIT(A) is contrary to the provision of law 
and hence, kindly be deleted in full. 
 
6. Rs.11,20,083/-: The ld. CIT(A) erred in law as well as on

totally denies its liability of charging and withdrawal of any such 
interest. The interest so charged/withdrawn, being contrary to the 
provisions of law and facts, kindly be deleted in full. 
 
 
2.1 The Ground No. 1 of the assessee is general in nature which does not require 
any adjudication by us. Hence, the same is dismissed. 
3.1  In  Ground No. 2,   the assessee has challenged the disallowance of Rs. 
10,83,901/- out of interest expenses incurred by the assessee on availing the bank 
overdraft facility which was debited in the profit and loss account and claimed in 
the return of income.  
3.2 Brief facts of the case are that the AO noticed from the Profit & Loss 
Account that the assessee made claim of deduction of Rs.1.96 Crores being the 
interest paid on bank Overdraft a/c (OD a/c) and from the details, he noticed that 
out of the bank OD a/c some investments were made in the mutual funds totalling 
to Rs. 1.5 Crores on different dates (at page 2 of the asstt. order). The assessee paid 
such interest at 6.25% and when asked as to why the proportionate interest relating 
to such investment in the mutual funds, of Rs. 10,83,901/- which, in the opinion of4 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
the AO, was the interest paid on borrowed funds for purchases of mutual units be 
not allowed, the assessee submitted a reply dated 23.01.2013 & 06.02.2013 
(reproduced at page 3 onwards of the asstt. order).The assessee mainly submitted 
that the object behind making investment is getting tax efficient income similar to 
bank interest. The income from mutual fund is not tax free as explained earlier 
also. The firm accumulated profit for its expansion plan and not taking any loan for 
the expansion plan. Further the annual account shows that the assessee had 
declared profit of Rs.50.76 Crores and the investment in the mutual funds a/c was 
merely of Rs. 1.5 Crores hence, such investment was out of assessee's own fund 
and was not out of borrowings. In support, some decisions were cited. The AO 
however, felt dissatisfied. He relied upon the decision in CIT v/s Abhishek 
Industries Ltd. (2006) 286 ITR Industries Ltd. (2006) 286 ITR 1 (P&H) and 
distinguished the decisions cited by the assessee. Finally, the AO computed interest 
paid at the rate of 6.25% in relation to the investment made in the mutual funds 
which was disallowed. 
3.3 In the first appeal, the ld. CIT (A) also confirmed the addition of 
Rs.10,83,901/- by observing as under:- 
‘’I have gone through Assessee's submissions and AO’s 
findings.  
The assessee also claimed that the income from mutual fund 
was not tax free.Therefore, the disallowance of corresponding 
interest was not justified. I have gone through the scheme of5 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
mutual fund it was seen that income received from the units of 
mutual fund was exempt in the hands of unit holder, only 
capital gain on sale of these units was taxable. 
From the above, it is clear that any additional sum received on 
redemption of these units was exempt in the hands of assessee 
and this plea of the assessee is therefore rejected. 
 
On similar facts for the A.Y. 2009-10 (783/2011-12), I have 
confirmed the addition of Rs.20,45,751/-observing as under: 
 
‘’The surplus funds of assessee were kept in the form of FDRS 
and the income from same was to be taxed as income from 
other sources. 
On the security of these FDRS the assessee availed overdraft 
facility and part of the funds out of over draft were used for 
purchasing mutual fund Units.  
As the income from mutual funds were exempt, any 
expenditure related to same has to be disallowed in view of 
specific provisions of section 14A of the I.T.Act.  
The assessee's plea that overdraft is its own money is not 
acceptable as FDRs were used as security for Over Draft and 
the source of investment was Over Draft and not its own 
money.  
 
e.g. If an assessee has placed house property as security 
for taking overdraft would we allow interest expenses against 
income from house property? No. 
The case laws cited by assessee are not relevant as in the 
case of assessee nexus between borrowed funds and investment 
as clearly established. The payments were directly made from 
overdraft account only and also admitted by assessee. 
Considering the above, disallowance of interest of 
Rs.20,45,751/- is confirmed. 
This Ground of appeal is, therefore, dismissed.’’ 
 
The facts of the current year are identical. Therefore, 
addition of Rs.10,83,901/- is confirmed. This ground of appeal 
is dismissed.’’6 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
3.4 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions praying therein that 
the ld. CIT(A) has erred in confirming the action of the AO.  
“1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the written submissions filed before the ld. 
CIT(A), which are reproduced at pg 2 to 6 & 15 to 17 of CIT(A) order. (PB 
152-173).  
 
2.1 The law is well settled that where assessee is having mixed i.e. interest 
free/interest bearing funds both, but the interest free funds are larger than 
the interest free advances than there will a presumption that the interest 
free advances were given out of the interest free funds (but not out of 
interest bearing fund/OD) and hence, no interest can be disallowed (as was 
not claimed).  
 
2.2 It is submitted that the cited decisions strongly support the contentions 
raised by the assessee. These decisions relate to disallowance of the interest 
expenditure incurred on the loan amount used for payment of income 
tax/investment in the securities/capital expenditure etc. or for giving interest 
free advances to its sister concerns etc. sourced out of the loan/OD a/c. The 
Hon’ble Courts in similar factual matrix (as available in this case) has taken 
a view in favour of the assessee.  
 
2.3 However, the lower authorities proceeded on misconception & 
misreading  of the judicial guidelines provided through various decisions 
which were in the context that where there are borrowed funds and also 
interest free funds both, discretion lies with the assessee for the utilization of 
the funds in whatever manner it wants. What has been held is that where 
there are funds available both interest-free and overdraft and/or loans 
taken, then a presumption would arise that interest free loans & advances 
would be out of interest free fund generated or available with the assessee, if 
the interest-free funds were sufficient to meet the investments and in such 
situation the specific nexus between utilization being of interest bearing 
bank overdraft towards interest free advances, loses significance/relevance.  
 
2.4 Huge interest free funds available: During the assessment proceedings, 
it was specifically submitted vide letter dated 23.01.2013 (supra)  (PB 51) 
that the assessee was having huge interest free capital. Moreover to support, 
copies of the Audited Balance Sheet as on 31.03.2010 (PB 4-27)  were7 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
submitted before the authorities below. A perusal therefore, clearly reveals 
that there was a huge interest free Capital and Reserve & Surplus which 
stood at Rs.74,91,19,817/- as on 31.03.2010 (A.Y.2010-11) and 
Rs.70,64,91,272/- as on 31.03.2009 (A.Y.2009-10). The subjected investment 
in mutual fund stood at Rs.3,00,00,000/- in the preceding year which 
decreased to Rs.1,50,00,000/- this year as shown in the Audited Balance 
Sheet as against that the assessee was having a huge interest free Capital 
and Reserve & Surplus of Rs.74,91,19,817/- (PB 9). The authorities below 
however, completely failed to disprove the above factual position. Current 
year’s profit was of Rs. 50.76 crores.  
 
3. Covered Matter:  
3.1 At the outset, the controversy involved in the present case is directly 
covered by the recent ITAT order dated 27.09.2017 in ITA no. 10/JP/13 
[190 TTJ 823 (JP)] is assessee’s own case for AY 99-00 on exactly identical 
facts (DPB 149-180 ). The relevant extracts are reproduced hereunder:  
 
“24…………….It also proves the fact that the assessee was having 
mixed funds both in form of business receipts and borrowings in the 
form of overdraft from the bank from time to time. However, there is 
nothing which has been brought on record to prove that the 
investments have been made at the relevant point in time out of the 
borrowed funds. In absence of establishing the necessary nexus being 
between the borrowings and the investments in the mutual funds, it 
can safely be concluded that the investments in the mutual fund units 
have been made out of mixed funds.  
 
25. …………The funds in the FDRs accounts clearly reflect the 
interest free funds which are available with the assessee which is far 
in excess of the amount of investments which has been made in the 
Mutual Funds units amounting to Rs. 3 Cr. Accordingly, on 
appreciation of the said facts and in absence of anything to the 
contrary, as per the settled legal proposition, a presumption can be 
drawn that the investments in the mutual fund units have been made 
out of interest- free funds and not out of interest bearing funds……”  
  
26. Lastly, coming to the contention of the learned CIT(A) that 
provisions of s. 14A are applicable as income from the Mutual Funds 
are exempt,  we find that the said finding is contrary to the facts on8 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
record. The appellant has invested in the fixed maturity plans of the 
various Mutual Funds which are basically fixed-term debt funds 
schemes. Where the amount is invested in such funds for less than a 
year, the maturity proceeds are taxable as short-term capital gain @ 
30 per cent and where the amount is invested in such funds for the 
period exceeding one year, the maturity proceeds are taxable @ 10 
per cent with the indexation benefit and @ 20 per cent without 
indexation benefits. In other words, the investments in Mutual Funds 
schemes are not tax-free investments . In support of its contentions, 
the learned Authorised Representative has also submitted a copy of 
the computation of income for the subsequent asst. yr. 2010-11 
wherein the maturity proceeds amounting to Rs. 3,32,35,500 of all 
these Mutual Funds units wherein the assessee has invested Rs. 
3,00,00,000 during the impugned assessment year have been offered 
to tax as long-term capital gains. In light of the same, we do not think 
that the learned CIT(A) was correct in invoking provisions of s. 14A 
of the Act.”  
 
The Rule of Consistency mandatorily requires that in absence of any 
material change in the facts and circumstances, the earlier decision 
rendered by the ITAT in the case of the same assessee must be followed. 
Kindly refer para-38 of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v/s DCIT 
& Anr. (2017) 151 DTR 0089 (SC) (DPBIII 181-186) wherein, the earlier 
decision in the case of Radhswami Satsang vs CIT (1992) 193 ITR 321 
(SC) at Pg-329 has been relied upon.  
 
The authorities below themselves have admitted that the facts of this year 
are identical with those in A.Y. 2009-10 hence there is no reason why the 
Hon`ble ITAT order of A.Y. 2009-10 should not be applied in this case. A 
chart showing financials is enclosed as Annexure 3 to revised w/s to ITAT 
dated 1st February 2021  
 
3.2 Also, in the case of ACIT v/s Ram Kishan Verma (2012) 143 TTJ 1 (Jp) 
(DPB - I 10-22), wherein the factual matrix is also the same. In fact, the 
cited case also of a coaching institute of Kota itself and there also the 
assessee used to receive the entire fees at the beginning of the year/session 
whereas it had to incur recurring expenditure on monthly basis. As a part of 
financial management/planning and to maximize its income, that assessee 
also used to deposit the entire fees in the FDRs and got OD A/c from which9 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
funds were utilized as per need. This way, it was claimed that it was 
assessee’s own money only who did not borrow any fresh money. The 
disallowance made by the AO u/s 36(i)(iii) was fully deleted by holding that  
 
“10.4 We have heard both the parties. The assessee is having 
sufficient capital. If there are mixed funds then non-interest-bearing 
funds are to be considered as utilized for non-interest-bearing 
advances. It is the assessee who has to take a business decision.  Fees 
is generally received at the beginning and surpluses are used for 
making fixed deposits as receipts are in advances while expenses are 
spread out throughout the year.  Since interest-free advances are less 
than the capital and the AO has not brought on record any nexus of 
interest-bearing loans used the AO could not have disallowed the 
interest. There is no onus on the assessee to establish that interest-
free advances are out of interest-bearing advances if non-interest-
bearing funds are more. Reliance is placed on the decision of the 
Hon’ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs. Reliance Utilities 
& Power Ltd. (2009) 221 CTR (Bom) 435 : (2009) 18 DTR (Bom) 1 : 
(2009) 313 ITR 340 (Bom) and Hon’ble Delhi High Court in the case 
of CIT vs. Bharti Televenture Ltd. (2011) 51 DTR (Del) 98 : 2010-
TIOL-51-HC-Del. There is no provision in the Act which may compel 
an assessee to earn income.  
11.1 x--------------x--------------x--------------x--------------x--------------
x--------------x  
 11.2 After considering the facts as above, we feel that the AO was not 
justified in  making any disallowance. Hence, disallowance is deleted.”  
 
3.3 The Hon`ble Rajasthan High Court has also affirmed  the above orders vide  
          para 12 & 14 in the case of CIT v/s Ram Kishan Verma (2016) 132 DTR 107 
(Raj.) (DPB 1-11) holding as under:  
 
“12. As far as the disallowance of interest is concerned, admittedly 
the assessee had an opening capital of Rs. 5,70,74,967/-  of his own 
and the advances, if at all, being interest free, is to the extent of Rs. 
98,93,950/- which is far below the capital of the assessee and, 
therefore, the tribunal has rightly come to the conclusion that to the 
extent of his own capital the assessee could advance money without 
interest for business expediency or/and relatives, and none can be 
forced to charge interest . It is also noticed by the lower authorities10 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
that assessee earned bank interest to the extent of Rs. 24,48,843/- out 
of which he paid total amount of Rs. 10,99,099/- to the bank against 
loan and over draft, and it is out of the amount which has been paid 
by the assessee at 10,99,099/- that the AO has disallowed the 
interest.      
 
13. Taking into consideration the fact as noticed hereinabove, in our 
view as well, when there was no agreement to charge interest from the 
persons to whom the assessee advance short term loan/advance, the 
AO could not disallow part of interest. It is also an admitted fact, as 
observed by the tribunal, that the AO was not able to pin pointedly 
come to a definite conclusion that how interest bearing loans has 
been diverted towards interest free advances and since the AO was 
not able to prove nexus between interest bearing loans vis-à-vis 
interest free loans/advances,  therefore, in our view as well, once the 
AO was not able to come to a definite conclusion as to nexus having 
been established about interest bearing loans having been diverted 
towards interest free loans/advances, and such being a finding of fact 
based on application of evidence, in our view no substantial question 
of law arise on this question as well. It can be observed that this court 
in similar circumstances and on identical facts, when the capital of 
the partner/proprietor being more than the interest free short term 
advances, has in the case of CIT v/s M/s. Vijay Solvex Ltd. (2015) 274 
CRT (Raj.) 384 while relying on the judgments rendered in (a) S.A. 
Builders Ltd. V/s  CIT (2007) 288 ITR 0001 (SC) ; (b) Munjal Sales 
Corporation v/s CIT (2008) 298 ITR 298 (SC) ; (c) CIT V/s Radico 
Khaitan Ltd. (2005) 274 ITR 354; (d) CIT v/s Dalmia Cement (Pvt.) 
Ltd. (2002) 254 ITR 377; (e) CIT v/s Britannia Industries Ltd. (2006) 
280 ITR 525; and (f) CIT v/s Motors Sales Ltd. (2008) 304 ITR 
123  (Allahabad), held as under:-  
 
x---------------x----------------x----------------x-------------------x---------x  
 
14. Therefore, the finding reached by the Tribunal is essentially a 
finding of fact based on the appreciation of the evidence, and we find 
no perversity or infirmity in the order impugned, and no question of 
law arises out of the order of ITAT.”11 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
3.4 For various other case laws, kindly refer Annexure 1 to Revised w/s to ITAT 
dated 1st February 2021  (The assessee in Annexure 1 has relied upon the cases of 
CIT v/s Radico Khaitan Ltd. (2005) 194 CTR 451/274 ITR 354 (All) (HC) , 
Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v/s DCIT & Anr. (2017) 151 DTR 
0089 (SC), East India Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v/s CIT (1997) 139 CTR 
0372 (SC), Munjal Sales Corporation v/s CIT (2008) 298 ITR 298 (SC), CIT 
vs. HDFC Bank LTD. (2016) 284 CTR 0409 (Bom)  (DPB 64-70), Hero Cycle P. 
Ltd vs. CIT (2015) 128 DTR 1/379 ITR 347 (SC), SEL Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 
vs. DCIT 206 TTJ 937 (Chd.), Alkali & Chemical Corporation of India Ltd. 
vs. CIT (1986) 50 CTR 139 (Kol HC)  and CIT v/s M/s. Vijay Solvex Ltd. 
(2015) 274 CTR 384 (Raj.) ) 
 
3.5 Further the case of Abhishek Industries has already been impliedly 
overruled in Munjal sales (supra) and was also so considered in the case of 
Ram Kishan Verma  by ITAT Jaipur.  
 
4. Settlement Commission:  The issue involved is otherwise also covered. A 
search was carried out in the case of assessee group and the matter reached 
to the Hon’ble Income Tax Settlement Commission, New Delhi. The issue of 
disallowance u/s 36(1)(iii) and the claim of liability towards the Scholarship 
payable have also been a subject matter of their consideration. These issues 
have been decided in the favour of the assessee in pr. 53.2  vide order dated 
26.04.2018 (III PB176-183 of A.Y 2010-11) . Though the assessment years 
involved are different, however, the said order fully support the contention 
of the assessee, in principal.  
5. The AO un-wantedly stressed  over the alleged absence of the commercial 
expediency behind giving of the subjected loans & advances in as much as, 
such a consideration was relevant only in a case where the interest free 
funds were given out of the interest bearing funds only and there was 
admittedly no availability of the interest free funds. In our case, such facts 
are not available and even otherwise the utilization of the funds was for 
commercial expediency in as much as the major utilization of the funds was 
towards capital investment in building for coaching, and partly in the 
mutual funds but income from both were duly taxed. It was not the case of 
AO that assessee diverted the funds to relatives etc. for personal purposes.12 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
In the case of SA Builders also, the decision was rendered in the context of 
diversion of the interest bearing funds to the interest free advances . The 
Hon’ble Rajasthan High Court in Ram Kishan Verma (Supra)  has also 
taken a note and interpreted the decision of SA Builder (Supra) in the same 
manner and therefore, held that to the conclusion that to the extent of his 
own capital the assessee could advance money without interest for business 
expediency or/and relatives, and none can be forced to charge interest.  
 
In DCIT v/s Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Co. Ltd. (2014) 31 ITR 
(Trib) 668 (Ahd) at page 671, it is held that  
 
“………….., the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of S.A. 
Builders Ltd. v. CIT(Appeals) [2007] 288 ITR 1 (SC) would not be 
applicable to the facts of the present case…….”  
 
6.1 No Interest paid on Partners’ Capital on current year profits: Its 
factually wrong that appellant paid interest on their capital. Factually there 
was no interest paid w.r.t. huge net-profits  of Rs.53.02 Cr. before 
depreciation and Rs. 50.76 Cr. after depreciation, of this year in as much as 
such interest was credited at the end  of the year. In other words, no interest 
at all was paid on the partners’ capital at least to the extent of the current 
year`s profit because profit was distributed at the end of the year and such 
interest, of course, was paid in the subsequent year.  
The current year profit is otherwise much bigger than the investment made 
in mutual fund this year of Rs.1.50 Cr. or the total investment at the close of 
the year.  
 
6.2.1 Interest on capital of partners: Even assuming some interest has been 
paid by the assessee to the partners to their respective capital yet however 
such interest is not a charge on the profit and not being an expenditure, it is 
nothing but an appropriation of profits  and such payment of interest cannot 
be kept at par as any interest paid / claimed u/s 36(1)(iii) of the Act.  It is 
submitted that the payment of interest (only on the capital), salary, bonus 
etc., are nothing but distribution (or appropriation out) of the profits earned 
by the partners collectively as partnership firm and such payment is nothing 
but a mode of distribution of such profits. This was and is a settled law. The 
payment of salary and interest to the partner were not allowable prior to the 
amendment made w.e.f. A.Y. 1993-94 but now a limit has been put u/s 40(b)13 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
of the Act. It is only for the limited purpose, to avoid double taxation, 
interest and salary are now being allowed (only u/s 40(b) (v), to be 
computed in a prescribed manner, w.r.t. the amount of “book profit”, as 
defined under Explanation 3 (  to mean the net profit as shown  in the profit 
& loss account for the relevant previous year, computed in the manner laid 
down……).This is based on the principle that the firm is not a separate legal 
entity but is a compendium of persons hence, a partner is not a separate 
person from the firm.  
 
6.2.2 Kindly refer CIT v/s R.N.Chidambaram 106 ITR 292 (SC), holding 
that  
 
"A firm is not a legal person, even though it has some attributes of 
personality. In Income-tax law, a firm is a unit of assessment, by special 
provisions, but it is not a full person. Since a contract of employment 
requires two distinct persons, viz., the employer and the employee, there 
cannot be a contract of service, in strict law, between a firm and one of 
its partners. Payment of salary to a partner represents a special share of 
the profits. Salary paid to a partner retains the same character of the 
income of the firm.  
Held accordingly, the salary paid to a partner by a firm which grows 
and sells tea, is exempt from tax, under rule 24 of the Indian Income-tax 
Rules, 1922, to the extent of 60 per cent thereof, representing 
agricultural income and is liable to tax only to the extent of 40 per cent."  
Further, in the case of CIT v. Ramniklal Kothari (1969) 74 ITR 57 (SC) , it 
is held that the business of the firm is business of the partners of the firm 
and, hence, salary, interest and profits received by the partner from the firm 
is business income and, therefore, expenses incurred by the partners for the 
purpose of earning this income from the firm are admissible as deduction 
from such share income from the firm in which he is partner. Section 4 of the 
Indian Partnership Act 1932 also support this contention. Thus, the 
'partnership firm' and partners have been collectively seen and the 
distinction between the two was removed in the judicial precedents even for 
taxation purposes.  
6.2.3 On the other hand, interest paid on borrowed capital u/s 36(1)(iii) 
presupposes a transaction between two independent entities, which is not the 
case here. Capital of a partner is not a borrowing and therefore, the Act14 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
does not cover interest on capital of partner u/s 36(1)(iii) but it’s limit of 
allowability has been prescribed u/s 40(b) only as appropriation out of 
profits.  
 
6.2.4 Sec 13 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 contains the mutual rights 
and liabilities of the partners. Sec 13(c) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 
reads as under:  
 
“13. Subject to contract between the partners –  
(c) where a partner is entitled to interest on the capital subscribed by him, 
such interest shall be payable only out of profits;”  
 
From above it is clear that interest on capital can be paid only out of 
profits, which implies that interest on capital is an appropriation and not an 
expense.  It means if in any particular year there are no profits, no interest 
on capital will be paid.  This happens only in case of appropriations. 
However, in case a where partner has given loan to the firm over and above 
his capital, the interest thereon being an expense is payable even if there are 
no profits. This is the reason interest on such loan is debited in the Profit & 
Loss A/c and not in the Profit and Loss Appropriation A/c.  
 
6.3 Supporting case laws:  
 
6.3.1 Kindly refer Quality Industries vs. JCIT, (2016) 73 taxmann.com 363 
(Pune Trib.) (DPB-IV 187-192). It was held as under:  
 
“11.5……………. Consequently interest paid to its partners cannot be 
treated at par with the other interest payable to outside parties. Thus, in 
absence, the revenue is not adversely affected at all by the claim of interest 
on capital employed with the firm by the partnership firm and partners put 
together. Thus, capital diverted in the mutual funds to generate alleged tax 
free income does not lead to any loss in revenue by this action of the assesse. 
In view of the inherent mutuality, when the partnership firm and its partners 
are seen holistically and in a combined manner with costs towards interest 
eliminated in contra, the investment in mutual funds generating tax free 
income bears the same characteristics of and attributable to its own capital 
where no disallowance under S. 14A read with Rule 8D is warranted. 
Consequently, the plea of the assesse is merited in so far as interest 
attributable to partners. However, the interest payable to parties other than15 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
partners, in our view, would be subjected to provisions of Rule 8D(2)(ii) of 
the Rules. Similarly, in the absence of any specific plea from assesse 
towards disallowance under Rule 8D(3), we hold it sustainable in view of 
express mandate of law. The matter is accordingly remanded back to the file 
of the Assessing Officer for re-computation of disallowance under Rule 8D 
r.w.s. 14A of the Act in terms of our opinion expressed herein above”  
 
6.3.2 The above decision was followed in M/s Syntholab Chemicals & 
Research vs. ACIT in ITA No. 4156/Mum/2015 dated 19.04.2017 (DPB-IV 
193-198).  
 
6.4 It is also pertinent to note that in A.Y.2009-10 also, the assessee made 
payment of interest on partner’s capital a/c yet however, the contention of 
the assessee of availability of the interest free funds in the shape of partner’s 
capital of Rs. 70.65 Cr., was accepted and disallowance made u/s 36(1)(iii) 
was completely deleted vide para 24 of the ITAT order dated 27.09.2017 in 
ITA No. 10/JP/2013 (DPB-III 149-180) . In the later years also similar facts 
prevailed but contention of the assessee was accepted by the Settlement 
Commission also. There being no change in the facts and circumstances, the 
decision taken by this Hon’ble Bench & Commission in the earlier/other 
year/s, is binding upon it and as a rule of consistency a similar view has to 
be adapted these years also.  
 
7. The ld.AO completely failed to deny and disprove the facts as argued 
although vide last para at pg 6, he alleged that the assessee had used a part 
of the borrowed funds available in the OD a/c and worked out the 
disallowable amount of the interest yet however, he completely failed to 
prove/ to bring contrary material to disprove that the assessee was having 
sufficient interest free funds, as aforesaid. He wrongly confused the OD a/c 
with an interest bearing loan/borrowings. Admittedly the assessee neither 
took any such loan in the past nor in this year, as evident from the Audited 
Balance Sheet as on 31.03.2010 (PB 10). 
 
8. Against the concept of real income: It is unfortunate that the department 
on one hand, happily taxed a huge extra interest income from Bank earned 
by the assessee because of its financial management but unfortunately 
deduction of the interest paid is disallowed. It can`t be denied that had the 
assessee did not put the funds into the FDR it could not have earned and 
paid substantial extra tax to the department and also it would not have16 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
incurred the cost of interest payment which, the department is now denying. 
Such an approach of the department is completely against the concept of 
real income. The department must have seen the substance instead of going 
into the form. Therefore, if extra interest income is taxed under the head 
`Income from other sources` the interest payment should have also been 
allowed u/s 57(iii).  
 
The disallowance may kindly be deleted in full in its entirety.”

3.5 During the course of hearing,  the ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings 
recorded by the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed 
by the ld. CIT(A) and prayed to  uphold the addition/disallowance.17 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
3.6 We have carefully considered the finding recorded in the impugned orders, 
the rival contentions raised by both the parties,  material placed on record and have 
also gone through the judicial pronouncements cited by the parties.  At the outset,  
it is observed that the law is well settled that where assessee is having mixed i.e. 
interest free/interest bearing funds both, but the interest free funds are larger than 
the interest free advances than there will be a presumption that the interest free 
advances were given out of the interest free funds (but not out of interest bearing 
fund/OD) and hence, no interest can be disallowed.  It is noticed that this year also 
the assesse continued maintaining account with the Canara Bank having Overdraft 
Account facility on the strength of the FDRs. A careful perusal of bank Overdraft 
account summary, bank FDR summary submitted along with the written 
submission as also perusal of the other materials placed in the Assessee’s Paper 
Book (APB) shows that all types of business receipts and all types of payments are 
routed through the bank Overdraft Account. This proves the fact that the assessee 
was having mixed funds both in form of business receipts and borrowings in the 
form of overdraft from the bank from time to time. It is also an admitted fact that 
apart from the overdraft account based on the FDR of the assesse, the assesse did 
not make any other borrowing or taken loan from any source as no such account 
appear in the balance sheet and annual statement of accounts of the assesse, placed 
at APB 4-27. Undisputedly, all the outgoing being the investment in the mutual18 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
fund, purchases of plot, construction of building, interest free loan & advances 
given to faculties or to some other charitable organisation (as may be noted in the 
next grounds of appeal), in the year before us, were made from the OD Account 
only or in other words, from the mixed funds being the interest free funds as also 
the interest bearing. The AO failed to establish the necessary nexus between the 
borrowings and the investment so made.  The facts and  material available on 
records shows that the assessee was having interest free capital and reserves & 
surplus of Rs. 74,91,19,817/- as on 31.03.2010 as appears from the Balance Sheet 
as on 31.03.2010 at APB 4-27. The current’s year profit itself was of Rs 50.76 
crore (which stood at Rs.53.02 crore before depreciation). There apart, the Mutual 
Funds of Rs. 3 crores in the preceding year were redeemed. These facts together 
with the fact based on the FDR summary submitted with written submission, 
shows that the interest free funds were much more in excess against the meager 
investment in Mutual Funds of Rs. 1.50 crores this year but also the investment 
made in the purchase of plot, construction, building etc. totalling to Rs. 
17,06,26,980/- ( Ground of Appeal No.4) and the loan given to charitable 
organizations of Rs. 1.41 lakhs ( Ground of Appeal No.3).  It is also noticed from 
the Balance Sheet that and the partners’ capital accounts that interest has been paid 
on the credit balance however, it is not disputed that such interest was computed 
and credited only with reference to the closing balance standing as on 31st March19 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
2010 on the year end, which, therefore implies that even assuming the capital was 
not interest free, in any case the capital to the extent of the current year’s profit of 
Rs. 50.76 crore (and before depreciation Rs. 53.02 crore) was completely interest 
free in as much as such net profit was credited in the respected capital account only 
at the year end and no interest could be credited in the current year at least. These 
facts could not be rebutted by the Ld. DR, we are also in agreement with the 
contention of the Ld. AR that such interest payment on the capital of partner is not 
an expenditure but is a case of appropriation of profits. Such payment of interest 
cannot be kept at par like any other interest paid.  The payment of interest (on the 
capital), salary, bonus etc., are nothing but distribution (or appropriation) of the 
profits. We derive support from the decisions in the cases of  CIT v/s 
R.N.Chidambaram 106 ITR 292 (SC), CIT v. Ramniklal Kothari  (1969) 74 ITR 57 
(SC), Quality Industries vs. JCIT, (2016) 73 taxmann.com 363 (Pune Trib.), M/s 
Syntholab Chemicals & Research vs. ACIT in ITA No. 4156/Mum/2015 dated 
19.04.2017 (copies of which are placed on record). We find that the controversy 
involved in the present case is directly covered by the case of ACIT v/s Ram 
Kishan Verma (2012) 143 TTJ 1 (Jp), wherein the factual matrix is also the same. 
In fact, the cited case also of a coaching institute of Kota itself and there also the 
assessee used to receive the entire fees at the beginning of the year/session whereas 
it had to incur recurring expenditure on monthly basis. As a part of financial20 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
management/planning and to maximize its income, that assessee also used to 
deposit the entire fees in the FDRs and got OD A/c from which funds were utilized 
as per need. This way, it was claimed that it was assessee’s own money only who 
did not borrow any fresh money. The disallowance made by the AO u/s 36(i)(iii) 
was fully deleted by holding that the Hon`ble Rajasthan High Court has also 
affirmed the above orders vide para 12 & 14 in the case of CIT v/s Ram Kishan 
Verma (2016) 132 DTR 107 (Raj.) holding as under: 
“12. As far as the disallowance of interest is concerned, admittedly the 
assessee had an opening capital of Rs. 5,70,74,967/- of his own and the 
advances, if at all, being interest free, is to the extent of Rs. 98,93,950/- 
which is far below the capital of the assessee and, therefore, the tribunal has 
rightly come to the conclusion that to the extent of his own capital the 
assessee could advance money without interest for business expediency 
or/and relatives, and none can be forced to charge interest. It is also noticed 
by the lower authorities that assessee earned bank interest to the extent of 
Rs. 24,48,843/- out of which he paid total amount of Rs. 10,99,099/- to the 
bank against loan and over draft, and it is out of the amount which has been 
paid by the assessee at 10,99,099/- that the AO has disallowed the interest.  
13. Taking into consideration the fact as noticed hereinabove, in our view as 
well, when there was no agreement to charge interest from the persons to 
whom the assessee advance short term loan/advance, the AO could not 
disallow part of interest. It is also an admitted fact, as observed by the 
tribunal, that the AO was not able to pin pointedly come to a definite 
conclusion that how interest bearing loans has been diverted towards 
interest free advances and since the AO was not able to prove nexus between 
interest bearing loans vis-à-vis interest free loans/advances, therefore, in 
our view as well, once the AO was not able to come to a definite conclusion 
as to nexus having been established about interest bearing loans having 
been diverted towards interest free loans/advances, and such being a finding 
of fact based on application of evidence, in our view no substantial question 
of law arise on this question as well. It can be observed that this court in 
similar circumstances and on identical facts, when the capital of the21 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
partner/proprietor being more than the interest free short term advances, 
has in the case of CIT v/s M/s. Vijay Solvex Ltd. (2015) 274 CRT (Raj.) 384 
while relying on the judgments rendered in (a) S.A. Builders Ltd. V/s CIT 
(2007) 288 ITR 0001 (SC); (b) Munjal Sales Corporation v/s CIT (2008) 298 
ITR 298 (SC) ; (c) CIT V/s Radico Khaitan Ltd. (2005) 274 ITR 354; (d) CIT 
v/s Dalmia Cement (Pvt.) Ltd. (2002) 254 ITR 377; (e) CIT v/s Britannia 
Industries Ltd. (2006) 280 ITR 525; and (f) CIT v/s Motors Sales Ltd. (2008) 
304 ITR 123 (Allahabad), held as under:-  
14. Therefore, the finding reached by the Tribunal is essentially a finding of 
fact based on the appreciation of the evidence, and we find no perversity or 
infirmity in the order impugned, and no question of law arises out of the 
order of ITAT.”  
 
On the aspect of the availability of current year profit before depreciation we also 
find support from the decision in the case of CIT vs Reliance Industries Ltd. 
(2018) 161 DTR 420 (Bom. HC)  wherein it was held as under: 
“Appeal (High Court)—Substantial question of law—Interest on borrowed 
capital—Net profit after tax and before depreciation exceeded not only the 
differential/incremental loan given to subsidiaries during the year but also exceeds 
the total interest-free loans given to the subsidiaries as on 31st March, 2003—A 
presumption would arise that the investment would be out of the interest-free funds 
generated or available with the company—If the Tribunal had allowed deduction 
and followed the earlier view and on facts, then, there is no perversity when 
nothing contrary to the factual material was brought on record by the Revenue—
No substantial question of law arises from such a view of the Tribunal”  
Vide Para-31  
“31. The facts were that, the assesse had given interest free loans to its 
subsidiaries aggregating to the sum specified in Para 7.2 as on 31st March, 2003 
and the corresponding figures of such interest free loans as on 31st March, 2002 
stood at Rs.2988.98 Crores. Thus, the differential loans given to subsidiaries 
during the year under consideration were worth Rs.3727.14 Crores. The net profit 
after tax and before depreciation was arrived at by the tribunal and which 
exceeded not only the differential/incremental loan given to subsidiaries during the 
year but also exceeds the total interest-free loans of Rs.6716.12 Crores given to the 
subsidiaries as on 31st March, 2003. Considering these facts, the Tribunal found 
that the position is not different from the prior asst. year 2002-03.”22 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
 
The facts are not disputed that a similar controversy based on the identical facts, 
was involved in the assesse’s own case for assessment year 2009-10, as also 
evident from the orders of the authorities below where they have followed their 
findings recorded in their respective orders for AY 2009-10. It is also not denied 
that based on similar contentions, identical facts and the controversy, the 
coordinate bench has decided the issue of allowability or otherwise u/s 14A and/or 
36(1)(iii) in that year vide order dated 27.09.2017 in ITA no. 10/JP/2013 [reported 
in 190 TTJ 823 (JP)] holding as under: 
“24 Regarding second issue as to whether the transactions in the 
bank overdraft account are limited to the borrowings and subsequent 
withdrawal for meeting expenditure and making the investments or it also 
includes other transactions in form of deposit of various business receipts 
including course fees as contended by the ld. AR, we find, on review of bank 
overdraft accounts summary details available at APB 45, that the assessee 
has an overdraft account with the Central Bank of India, Talwandi Branch, 
Kota wherein the opening credit balance is Rs. 28 Cr. and closing credit 
balance is Rs. 33 Cr and during the year, we find that there are deposits of 
Rs. 115.53 Cr and withdrawal of Rs. 120.85 Cr. The said numbers therefore 
supports the contention advanced by the ld. AR during the course of the 
assessment proceedings that all types of business receipts and all type of 
payments are routed through the bank overdraft account. It also proves the 
fact that the assessee was having mixed funds both in form of business 
receipts and borrowings in the form of overdraft from the bank from time to 
time. However, there is nothing which has been brought on record to prove 
that the investments have been made at the relevant point in time out of the 
borrowed funds. In absence of establishing the necessary nexus being 
between the borrowings and the investments in the mutual funds, it can 
safely be concluded that the investments in the mutual fund units have been 
made out of mixed funds.23 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
 
25.  Now coming to the third issue as to where assessee is having 
mixed funds and interest free funds are larger than the amount of 
investments made during the year, can a presumption be drawn that the 
investments in the mutual fund units have been made out of interest- free 
funds and not out of interest bearing funds. In this regard, we find that the 
assessee is having opening bank balance in their FDR account at the 
beginning of the year amounting to Rs. 62.99 Cr. and closing balance of Rs. 
98.03 Cr with fresh FDRs made during the year amounting to Rs 58.03 Cr 
and FDRs matured during the year amounting to Rs 22.99 Cr. The funds in 
the FDRs accounts clearly reflect the interest free funds which are available 
with the assessee which is far in excess of the amount of investments which 
has been made in the Mutual Funds units amounting to Rs. 3 Cr. 
Accordingly, on appreciation of the said facts and in absence of anything to 
the contrary, as per the settled legal proposition, a presumption can be 
drawn that the investments in the mutual fund units have been made out of 
interest- free funds and not out of interest bearing funds.  
  
26. Lastly, coming to the contention of the learned CIT(A) that 
provisions of s. 14A are applicable as income from the Mutual Funds are 
exempt, we find that the said finding is contrary to the facts on record. The 
appellant has invested in the fixed maturity plans of the various Mutual 
Funds which are basically fixed-term debt funds schemes. Where the amount 
is invested in such funds for less than a year, the maturity proceeds are 
taxable as short-term capital gain @ 30 per cent and where the amount is 
invested in such funds for the period exceeding one year, the maturity 
proceeds are taxable @ 10 per cent with the indexation benefit and @ 20 
per cent without indexation benefits. In other words, the investments in 
Mutual Funds schemes are not tax-free investments. In support of its 
contentions, the learned Authorised Representative has also submitted a 
copy of the computation of income for the subsequent asst. yr. 2010-11 
wherein the maturity proceeds amounting to Rs. 3,32,35,500 of all these 
Mutual Funds units wherein the assessee has invested Rs. 3,00,00,000 
during the impugned assessment year have been offered to tax as long-term 
capital gains. In light of the same, we do not think that the learned CIT(A) 
was correct in invoking provisions of s. 14A of the Act.”24 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
 We have also carefully gone through the various decisions cited by the AR in the 
cases of CIT v/s M/s. Vijay Solvex Ltd. (2015) 274 CTR 384 (Raj.), CIT v/s 
Radico Khaitan Ltd. (2005) 194 CTR 451/274 ITR 354 (All) (HC), East India 
Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v/s CIT (1997) 139 CTR 0372 (SC), CIT vs. HDFC 
Bank LTD. (2016) 284 CTR 0409 (Bom), Hero Cycle P. Ltd vs. CIT (2015) 128 
DTR 1/379 ITR 347 (SC). However, we find the decision cited by the ld. DR in the 
case of CIT v/s Abhishek Industries Ltd. (2006) 286 ITR 1 (P&H) has already 
being distinguished in this context by the above decisions. In light of above 
discussions and in the entirety of facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the 
view that the lower authorities were  not justified in disallowing interest expense of 
Rs. 10,83,901/- in the hands of the assessee. H ence Ground No. 2 of the assessee  
is allowed.  
4.1 In Ground of Appeal No. 3,  the relevant facts in brief are that the AO noticed 
from Annexure E of Balance Sheet that the assessee has given advance of Rs.1.00 
lakh to Akhil Bhatiya Maheshwari Educational Charitable Trust on 01.07.2009 and 
shown debit balance of Rs. 41,000/- in the a/c of Swanand Sewanyas in the earlier 
years, but no interest was charged on these advances hence, he disallowed interest 
@ 6.25% on this advance as was paid out of the borrowed funds.25 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
4.2 In the first appeal, the ld. CIT(A) also confirmed the same, following his 
finding in AY 2009-10 that the assessee failed to submit any evidence to show that 
amount were advanced for any business purpose. The funds were advanced from 
the Overdraft Account. 
4.3 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions praying therein to 
delete the addition of Rs.7,236/- as confirmed by the ld. CIT(A)  
‘’Before the ld. CIT(A) it was submitted that Akhil Bhatiya Maheshwari 
Educational Charitable Trust and Swanand Sewanyas no interest was 
charged on such advances. However, it appears that the ld. CIT(A) has not 
at all paid any attention to the submission. It is submitted that there can’t be 
any notional interest as held in the case of Shoorji Ballabh Das & Co. 39 
ITR 0775 (SC) hence, this disallowance is bad in law. Otherwise, there 
being sufficient interest free funds already available with the assessee as 
stated in the grounds no. 2 & 4, it can’t be said that there was borrowing 
made for this purpose also. Hence the impugned disallowance kindly be

4.4 In Ground of Appeal No. 4, the relevant facts in brief are as noted by the AO 
are that the assessee  has given advances totalling to Rs.17.67 crores on different 
dates, which were utilized towards the purchase of plots of land, construction of a 
building known as CP, Rajeev Gandhi Nagar, Kota. The construction of the 
building was put to use in July, 2009. There apart, such amount was also utilized 
towards the construction work in progress in a building at Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, 
upto Rs.2,11,10,151/-.  The AO, with reference to the proviso to Sec.36(1)(iii)26 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
asked the assessee, in reply to which, the assessee vide letter dated  23.01.2013 
(AO Pg 14) stated that the assessee was having no Current a/c and it has only OD 
a/c based on the FDRs purchased from assessee’s own money and such advances 
were made out of current year’s profits which were to the tune of Rs.50.76 Crores 
(before allocation amongst partners). It was also stated that Sec..36(1)(iii) is 
applicable only when some capital is borrowed, whereas, in this case the assessee 
has not practically borrowed any money  and hence, there was no occasion to claim 
interest nor of disallowance thereof. It was only a part of the financial 
management/planning adopted by the assessee. The AO feeling dissatisfied, 
however, concluded that the subjected interest expenditure on the funds used from 
the Bank OD a/c, which was a loan and hence, deduction in respect of the interest 
on account of purchase of plots of Rs.3,34,868/- on Plot. No.1, Rajiv Gandhi 
Nagar, Kota, Rs.13,38,412/- on Plot No.6, Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Kota, 
Rs.54,20,422/- on Plot No. CP-7, Indra Vihar, Kota and Rs.5,66,465/- on account 
of construction of building on C.P., Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Kota, which totalling  to 
Rs.76,60,166/-, was disallowed. 
4.5 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions for deletion of 
disallowance confirmed by the ld. CIT(A)  
‘’1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the written submissions filed before the 
ld. CIT(A) , which are reproduced at pg 2-6 & 15-17 of the order (PB 156-
158, 162) .27 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
 
2. When asked by the AO (vide para VII of order sheet at the date 
15.01.2013), the assessee filed a detail explanation vide letter dated 
23.01.2013 (PB 47-52)  reproduced at pages 10 & 14 of the AO wherein the 
above facts were clearly mentioned. Amongst other things it was stated that 
the current year’s profit was of Rs.50.76 crores whereas the amount of 
construction WIP and the plot was only Rs.19.37 crores which was nothing 
but out of the interest free funds available in the shape of capital and 
reserves (including the current year is profits). And therefore it was 
contended that once the assessee was having more than sufficient own 
interest free funds, the assessee did not at all make any borrowing of fresh 
money during the year and did not have any opening balance on that 
account to be utilized towards the investment in the towards the capital 
investment being purchase of plots and/or construction etc. The AO 
completely failed to deny and disprove these facts  although vide para 2.3.7 
at pg 13 he alleged that the assessee had used a part of the borrowed funds 
available in the OD a/c and worked out the disallowable amount of the 
interest based on the withdrawal made out of the OD A/c yet however, he 
completely failed to prove/ to bring contrary material to the contention that 
the assessee was having sufficient interest free funds as aforesaid.  
 
 3.1 As regards the disallowances made in respect to interest on the alleged 
borrowings utilized for capital investment, our contentions can better be 
understood by referring to the facts involved and the decision rendered in 
the case of CIT v/s Reliance Utilities & Power Ltd. (2009) 313 ITR 340 
(Mum) (DPB 44-49), which is also a case where for making capital 
investment in the shares of two companies, disallowance was made. It was 
held that 
 
“The facts of that case were that the Assessee viz. M/s Reliance Utilities and 
Power Ltd. had invested certain amounts in Reliance Gas Ltd. and Reliance 
Strategic Investments Ltd. It was the case of the Assessee that they 
themselves were in the business of generation of power and they had earned 
regular business income therefrom. The investments made by the Assessee in 
M/s Reliance Gas Ltd. And M/s Reliance Strategic Investments Ltd. were 
done out of their own funds and were in the regular course of business and 
therefore no part of the interest could be disallowed. It was also pointed out 
that the Assessee had borrowed Rs.43.62 crores by way of issue of 
debentures and the said amount was utilised as capital expenditure and28 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
inter-corporate deposit. It was the Assessee's submission that no part of the 
interest bearing funds (viz. Issue of debentures) had gone into making 
investments in the said two companies. It was pointed out that the income 
from the operations of the Assessee was Rs.313.53 crores and with the 
availability of other interest free funds with the Assessee the amount 
available for investments out of its own funds were to the tune of Rs.398.19 
crores. In view thereof, it was submitted that from the analysis of the 
balance-sheet, the Assessee had enough interest free funds at its disposal for 
making the investments. The CIT (Appeals) on examining the said material, 
agreed with the contention of the Assessee and accordingly deleted the 
addition made by the Assessing Officer and directed him to allow the same 
under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Revenue being 
aggrieved by the order preferred an Appeal before the ITAT who upheld the 
order of the CIT (Appeals) and dismissed the Appeal of the Revenue. From 
the order of the ITAT, the Revenue approached this Court by way of an 
Appeal.”  
 
On the above factual matrix, the Hon’ble court held as under:  
 
 “10. If there be interest-free funds available to an assessee sufficient to 
meet its investments and at the same time the assessee had raised a loan it 
can be presumed that the investments were from the interest-free funds 
available. In our opinion the Supreme Court in East India Pharmaceutical 
Works Ltd. (supra) had the occasion to consider the decision of the Calcutta 
High Court in Woolcombers of India Ltd. (supra) where a similar issue had 
arisen. Before the Supreme Court it was argued that it should have been 
presumed that in essence and true character the taxes were paid out of the 
profits of the relevant year and not out of the overdraft account for the 
running of the business and in these circumstances the appellant was 
entitled to claim the deductions. The Supreme Court noted that the argument 
had considerable force, but considering the fact that the contention had not 
been advanced earlier it did not require to be answered. It then noted that in 
Woolcomber’s case (supra) the Calcutta High Court had come to the 
conclusion that the profits were sufficient to meet the advance tax liability 
and the profits were deposited in the overdraft account of the assessee and 
in such a case it should be presumed that the taxes were paid out of the 
profits of the year and not out of the overdraft account for the running of the 
business. It noted that to raise the presumption, there was sufficient material 
and the assessee had urged the contention before the High Court. The29 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
principle therefore would be that if there are funds available both interest-
free and overdraft and/or loans taken, then a presumption would arise that 
investments would be out of the interest-free fund generated or available 
with the company, if the interest-free funds were sufficient to meet the 
investments. In this case this presumption is established considering the 
finding of fact both by the CIT(A) and Tribunal.”  
 
3.2 Principally, in the instant case also the facts are the same as were 
obtaining in the case of Reliance Utilities (supra) in as much as in both the 
cases, the investments were made in capital asset (whether in the shares of 
the two companies as was the case with Reliance Utilities (supra) or 
investment in the capital asset i.e. plot purchase, construction etc which 
makes no difference but at both the places, the common contentions of the 
assessee are that there were no borrowing made as such in as much as the 
assessee was already having sufficient interest free funds at its disposal 
therefore, such investment/outgoing on capital account should be treated to 
have gone out of the availability of interest free funds but not from the 
interest bearing funds, if any. This way, there was no occasion for the 
assessee to make a claim of deduction nor for the AO to have made 
disallowance u/s 36(1)(iii) of the Act.   
 
4.1 it is submitted that the issue is directly covered  by the decision of CIT 
vs Reliance Industries Ltd. (2018) 161 DTR 420 (Bom. HC)  (DPB V 199-
2019) wherein it was held as under: 
 
“Appeal (High Court)—Substantial question of law—Interest on borrowed 
capital—Net profit after tax and before depreciation exceeded not only the 
differential/incremental loan given to subsidiaries during the year but also 
exceeds the total interest-free loans given to the subsidiaries as on 31st 
March, 2003—A presumption would arise that the investment would be out 
of the interest-free funds generated or available with the company—If the 
Tribunal had allowed deduction and followed the earlier view and on facts, 
then, there is no perversity when nothing contrary to the factual material 
was brought on record by the Revenue—No substantial question of law 
arises from such a view of the Tribunal”  
 
Vide Para-3130 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
“31. The facts were that, the assesse had given interest free loans to its 
subsidiaries aggregating to the sum specified in Para 7.2 as on 31st March, 
2003 and the corresponding figures of such interest free loans as on 31st 
March, 2002 stood at Rs.2988.98 Crores. Thus, the differential loans given 
to subsidiaries during the year under consideration were worth Rs.3727.14 
Crores. The net profit after tax and before depreciation was arrived at by 
the tribunal and which exceeded not only the differential/incremental loan 
given to subsidiaries during the year but also exceeds the total interest-free 
loans of Rs.6716.12 Crores given to the subsidiaries as on 31st March, 2003. 
Considering these facts, the Tribunal found that the position is not different 
from the prior asst. year 2002-03.”  
 
The above decision stands affirmed  by Hon`ble Apex Court in the case of 
CIT vs. Reliance Industries Ltd. (2019) 410 ITR 466 (SC) / (2019) 175 DTR 
1 (SC)  
 
4.2 The case of CIT vs Reliance Industries Ltd. (Supra) squarely fits in the 
case of the assesse. The profit of Rs.53.02 Crores (before depreciation and 
Rs.50.76 Cr. after depreciation) is much bigger than the incremental amount 
incurred on construction/purchase during the year which is merely Rs.17.06 
Crores. The profits of the year not only exceeds the incremental amount 
but also the total amount of Rs.22.56 Crores.  Such profits are interest free 
as were credited at the year end.  
 
5. The profits of the year exceeds the Incremental as well as the closing 
value of investment and construction  not only in this year but in every 
subsequent year. This position can be depicted by way of a table given 
below.

6. Covered Issue: The Hon’ble ITAT in assessee’s own case for AY 2009-10 
vide order dated 27.09.2017 has deleted the disallowance (Pages 20-51). 
Following this decision the Ld. CIT(A) has also deleted the disallowance in 
AY 2013-14 vide order dated 01.02.2018  
 
7. Our detailed submissions made towards GOA 2 and various case laws are 
also relied upon and may kindly be considered.  
 
8.1 The above submissions have been made on the basis that once the 
assessee was having sufficient interest free funds and did not borrow hence 
there was no question of paying any interest nor making any claim thereof. 
Thus, when in the view of the facts and submissions made above, there was 
no claim made by the assessee u/s 36(i)(iii), there was no question of 
allowing or disallowing the same and consequently even the discussion 
made by the AO in the light of the proviso to Sec.36(i)(iii) is also 
irrelevant . 
8.2 However, alternatively  and without prejudice to the above basic 
contention, even considering the claim on merits, the AO has wrongly 
considered the facts and alleged that the asset was not put to use in this 
year.  
With regard to the user of the plot no 1 at Rajeev Gandhi Nagar as a cycle 
stand, w.r.t. “observation” and allegation of the AO contained in para 2.3.2, 
2.3.3 and 2.3.5, it is submitted that our submissions made vide para no. 1 of 
letter dated 04.03.2013 (PB 58) reproduced in para 2.3.4 of the AO pg 12, 
are strongly relied upon which has adequately answered the allegations 
made. Despite these submissions, the AO and ld. CIT(A) both continued 
repeating the same factual allegation with blind eyes. They did not 
appreciate that the matter pertained to F.Y.2009-10 whereas inspector made 
the enquiries in February, 2013 i.e. after a lapse of period of almost 3 years 
by which time, on the vacant plot also, building stood constructed and the 
evidences furnished by the assessee being the electricity bill further proved 
the use of the plot as a parking place Pg 40-41 before the AO (PB 104-105)  
were completely ignored. Therefore, it has to be admitted that the said plot 
was put to use as a cycle stand in the relevant year only  and hence 
otherwise on merits also, the claim of  interest made u/s 36(1)(iii) was not 
hit by its proviso . The allegation of the AO that it was a costly plot to be 
used as cycle stand, is nothing more than a suspicion which is not 
permissible for making a valid assessment as held in the case of 
Dhakeshwari Cotton Mills Ltd 26 ITR  26 ITR 0775 (SC).32 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
 
8.3 In any case, the same is allowable u/s 57(iii) in both grounds. The 
impugned disallowance may kindly be deleted in full. ‘’  
 
4.6 During the course of hearing, the  ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings 
recorded by the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed 
by the ld. CIT(A) and prayed to uphold the addition/disallowance. 
4.7 We have heard the rival contentions and pursued the material available on 
record. The facts and circumstances of the case are similar to the one which we 
have examined in detail in Ground no. 2 above. Apart from what has already been 
stated and held in preceding paras, it is noticed that the incremental outgoings in 
the shape of investment in mutual fund, investment in construction, loans and 
advances etc. totalling to Rs. 18.56 Crores as also the closing balances of the 
interest free outgoings up to 31.03.2010, were far below the current year’s profit of 
Rs. 50.76 Crores and net profit before depreciation at Rs. 53.02 crores. A table 
submitted by the assesse in its written submission (not controverted by the Ld. DR) 
and reproduced somewhere in this order, support this conclusion. Our findings and 
directions contained in Ground No. 2 shall mutatis mutandis  to these grounds of 
appeal as well. Thus the Grounds No. 3 and 4 of the assessee’s appeal are 
allowed.33 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
5.1 In Ground No.5 , the dispute is with regard to the allowability of the claim 
deduction of Rs. 19,20,000/- on account of the Scholarship Scheme being run by 
the assessee. The disallowance was made mainly on the ground that it was a 
contingent and unascertained liability, which was based on condition of completion 
of 4 year course and moreover, it was a mere provision which was not allowable 
under the provisions of the Act. Hence, as against the claimed deduction of Rs 
19,20,000/-, only Rs 3,60,000/- was allowed and the balance of Rs 15,60,000/- 
shown as payable at the year-end was disallowed.  
5.2 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions with prayer to delete 
the addition confirmed by the ld. CIT(A). 
 
1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the detailed written submissions filed 
before the ld. CIT(A) , which are reproduced at pg. 28 to 29 of the order of 
CIT(A). 
 
2. It is submitted that the assessee is one of the most popular coaching 
institute of the Country, imparting coaching to the students preparing for 
entrance examinations. With a view to encourage the successful & 
intelligent students and to provide them with a financial support (which is 
otherwise, a part of its Advertisement - Promotional Schemes), the assessee 
has been floating scholarship schemes in the past. As per the scholarship 
scheme, for selection of the eligible candidates (who got coaching from the 
assessee’s institute), selection is made of those students, who are amongst 
the first 100 Ranks in AIPMT/IIT or the students who got selected in AIIMS, 
total amount of Rs.48,000/- per student is given. The assessee used to 
organize a big level function in the honour of the successful students, during 
the course of which they are honoured by giving them the certificates along 
with the cheques. Accordingly, the entire amount of Rs.19,20,000/- [Rs. 
48,000/-*43 (27 + 15 + 1-3)] was provided this year. Also accordingly, 4834 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
pre-dated cheques (PDI) were given to all the 43 students. This year, 
Rs.3,60,000/- [40 * Rs. 9,000/- (Rs. 1,000/- for July to March - 9 months)] 
was paid, based on the cheques already given to the successful students. 
Therefore, the balance of Rs.15,60,000/- was shown as payable at the end of 
the year, which were  paid in subsequent years (i.e. cheques 9 + 12 + 12 + 3 
in A.Y.2011-12 to 2014-15) as & when the concerned student got the cheque 
en-cashed. The bonafidies and allowabilities u/s 37(1) is not disputed.  
 
3. It is submitted that the authorities below entertained factual and legal 
misconception  by saying that the liability was not existent/ascertained or 
contingent for the simple reason that the liability relating to the subjected 
amount, was not only fully ascertained & existed but was even quantified on 
the very day, when the result of the Scholarship Scheme, selecting the 
eligible candidates was announced and in the award function they were 
tendered 48 cheques each. In terms of the Scheme, the assessee, of course, 
by its own admission, was liable to make payment of the scholarship amount 
to the selected candidates for the period of four years as agreed.  
 
4. Such liability was assumed and admitted by the assessee without any 
condition as to the selected candidate must complete the course selected that 
to for the entire period of four years. The AO wrongly alleged that such a 
liability was conditional in as much as in the prospectus (PB 174), no 
condition at all, was imposed. the student was free to continue/discontinue 
the course/to continue in the same institution or to change. Since the courses 
were for a period of four years hence, the assessee based this for the 
quantification of the amount of award/scholarship. The assessee therefore, 
committed itself from the moment the candidates were selected for the 
scholarship scheme. Whether all or part of the students continue or not (for 
whatsoever reason), the liability which has already accrued, could not have 
been stopped or could not be termed as contingent. The assessee could not 
have assumed that some of the students may not be willing or may not be 
able to complete the full term of four years, which otherwise was not a 
condition of granting scholarship.  
 
5.1 The authorities below therefore, proceeded on a misconception by 
considering the subjected expenditure as a provision only whereas, it was a 
liability in praesenti, as stated above, out of which Rs.3.60 Lacs could be got 
en-cashed this year however, balance of Rs.15,60,000/- remained 
outstanding in its Balance Sheet. Thus, it was nothing but an outstanding35 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
liability which has been wrongly named as a provision or a  contingent 
liability by the authorities below. Notably, in A.Y.2011-12 to 2014-15, the 
cheques of entire balance of Rs.15,60,000/- got en-cashed and thus, stood 
paid. Such liability was certain as did not depend on happening of any event. 
There was no uncertain future event.  
 
5.2 For better appreciation the meaning of the relevant terms are:  
 
Outstanding Liability:  Expenses relating to current year but actual payment 
to be incurred in the next financial years is outstanding expenses.  
 
Provision: Provision is a present liability of uncertain amount, which can be 
measured reliably by using a substantial degree of estimation.  
 
Contingent Liability: It is a possible obligation which may or may not be 
arise depending on happening or not happening of an uncertain future 
event. 
 
6A. No Loss to Revenue: After the valid creation of liability, if a part of the 
scholarship cheques is not en-cashed, the related amount shall be written 
back and in the scheme of income tax, Sec.41(1) fully takes care and such 
amount is deemed to be an income in the year in which it is credited back. 
Thus, the liability relating to subjected amount stood ascertained and 
crystallized in the subjected year itself and is fully allowable.  
 
6B. Accounting entries are not decisive of true nature of transaction. Kindly 
refer Kedarnath Jute Mfg. Co. Ltd. v/s CIT (1971) 82 ITR 0363 (SC)  and 
Sutlej Cotton Mills Ltd. v/s CIT (1979) 116 ITR 0001 (SC).  
 
7.1 Supporting Case Law: See Annexure 2 to revised w/s to ITAT dated 1st 
February 2021  
7.2 Cases cited by Revenue are completely distinguishable:  See Annexure 
2 to revised w/s to ITAT dated 1st February 2021.  
(The assessee in Annexure 2 has relied upon the cases of Bharat Earth 
Movers v/s CIT (2000) 162 CTR 325/245 ITR 428 (SC), CIT vs. Indian 
Transformers Ltd. (2004) 192 CTR 0216/270 ITR 0259 (KerHC), CIT

8. No disallowance made in past:  
8.1 It is pertinent to note that although the appellant has been making 
similar claims in the past based on the similarly floated schemes for the 
encouragement of the students in similar manner & method. Details of some 
years is an under:  
 
Scholarship to students :  
  
Asst. Year  Amount(Rs.)  
2006-07 8,16,000/-  
2007-08 16,80,000/-  
2008-09 17,76,000/-  
2009-10 20,16,000/-  
2010-11 19,20,000/-  
 
No disallowance were made in the earlier years.  
 
Even the assessments of some of the years were completed under scrutiny u/s 
143(3) (i.e. A.Y.2002-03 & onwards) yet however, no similar disallowance 
had been made in the past. It is, for the first time, the AO has made this 
disallowance despite there being no change in the fact & circumstances of 
the case. There were no special reason as to why the AO should have taken 
a departure from the settled position of law & facts between the parties. 
Although the doctrine of res judicata do not apply in the income tax 
proceedings yet however, in absence of any change in the facts & 
circumstances of the case, the doctrine has been applied by the Courts.  
 
8.2 In the case of CIT v/s Excel Industries Ltd. (2013) 358 ITR 295 (SC) , it 
was held that  
“Secondly, as noted by the Tribunal, a consistent view had been taken 
in favour of the assessee, starting with the AY 1992-93, that the 
benefits under the advance licences or under the duty entitlement pass 
book do not represent the real income of the assessee. Consequently, 
there was no reason to take a different view unless there are very 
convincing reasons, none of which had been pointed out by the 
Revenue. In Radhasoami Satsang Saomi Bagh v. Commissioner of 
Income Tax, [1992] 193 ITR 321 (SC) Court did not think it 
appropriate to allow the reconsideration of an issue for a subsequent37 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
AY if the same "fundamental aspect" permeates in different AYs.  It 
appears from the record that in several AYs, the Revenue accepted the 
order of the Tribunal in favour of the assessee and did not pursue the 
matter any further but in respect of some AYs the matter was taken up 
in appeal before the High Court but without any success. That being 
so, the Revenue could not be allowed to flip-flop on the issue 
further.” 
 
8.3 Sardar Kehar Singh v/s CIT (1991) 92 CTR 88/195 ITR 769 (Raj)  
 
8.4 Although specific submissions were made before the ld. CIT(A) and his 
attention was drawn to this fact yet however, he completely remained silent.  
 
9.1 Settlement Commission: The issue involved is otherwise also covered. 
A search was carried out in the case of assessee group and the matter 
reached to the Hon’ble Income Tax Settlement Commission, New Delhi. The 
issue of disallowance u/s 36(1)(iii) and the claim of liability towards the 
Scholarship payable have also been a subject matter of their consideration. 
These issues have been decided in the favour of the assessee vide order 
dated 26.04.2018 (III PB176-183) . Though the assessment years involved 
are different, however, the said order fully support the contention of the 
assessee, in principal.  
 
9.2 Thereapart, w.r.t. disallowance of Scholarship Payable, we are 
submitting herewith an at a glance chart (PB184) showing that the  
liability created in the subjected years, i.e. A.Y. 2010-11 & 11-12 stood paid 
off in later years and in some cases where the cheques were not encashed by 
the awardee-payee, the same stood credited back to the scholarship 
expenses. Even in the order of the Settlement Commission, there is a 
categorical finding expressing satisfaction  of this factual aspect based on 
their sample test checking.  
 
9.3 In any case, if it is not held allowable this year, the same has to be 
allowed in the year of payment, else it will amount to double taxation.   
  
Hence, the impugned disallowance kindly be deleted in full.’’38

5.3 During the course of hearing, the ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings 
recorded by the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed 
by the ld. CIT(A) and prayed to upheld the addition/disallowance. 
 
5.4  We have carefully considered the finding recorded in the impugned orders, 
the rival contentions raised by both the parties as also the material placed on record 
and have also gone through the judicial pronouncements cited by the parties. It is 
evidently clear that the authorities below have not properly appreciated the 
undisputed facts of the scholarship scheme and the legal position. We find that the 
scheme has been designed, with a view to encouraging  and providing  financial 
assistance to the meritorious students.  The assessee as a part of its advertisement 
and promotional scheme had been floating scholarship schemes in the past and also 
in the later years, as was also done in the current year. As per the scholarship 
scheme for selection of the eligible candidates (who got coaching from the 
assessee’s institute), selection is made of those students, who are amongst the first 
100 Ranks in AIPMT/IIT or the students who got selected in AIIMS, and total 
amount of Rs. 48,000/- per student p.a. is given. The assessee used to organize a 
big level function in the honour of the successful students, during the course of 
which they are awarded by giving them the certificates along with the cheques. 
Accordingly, the entire amount of Rs.19,20,000/- [Rs. 48,000/-*43 (27 + 15 + 1-39 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
3)] was provided this year. Also accordingly, 48 pre-dated cheques (PDI) were 
given to all the 43 students. This year, Rs.3,60,000/- [40 * Rs. 9,000/- (Rs. 1,000/- 
for July to March - 9 months)] was paid, based on the cheques already given to the 
successful students. Therefore, the balance of Rs.15,60,000/- is shown as payable 
at the end of the year, which were paid in subsequent years (in cheques 9 + 12 + 12 
+ 3 in A.Y.2011-12 to 2014-15) as & when the concerned student got the cheque 
en-cashed. The bonafidies and allowabilities u/s 37(1) is not disputed. Such 
liability was assumed and admitted by the assessee without any condition as the 
selected candidate must complete the course selected for the entire period of four 
years. On this aspect attention was drawn towards a copy of the prospectus placed 
at PB 174 wherein we find that there was no condition or stipulation imposed upon 
the student to complete the entire course and he was at liberty to continue or 
discontinue the course. Since the quantification of the liability is based on the 
amount of Rs 48,000/- p.a. for the total period 4 years for 43 eligible candidates, it 
amounted to Rs 19.20 Lakhs and as soon as the candidate was declared eligible and 
was awarded the scholarship fee, the assessee certainly committed itself towards 
such liability which is not only quantified and ascertained but was very much 
legally in existence on its pronouncement during the course of the functions and 
otherwise also, irrespective of the fact whether the entire amount so committed is 
paid during the year or is paid in part in the coming years. Thus, it was neither40 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
mere provision nor a contingent liability nor nonexistent or unascertained liability 
as wrongly alleged by the authorities. Out of the total liability created this year of 
Rs 19.20 Lakhs, the assessee could made payment of Rs 3.60 Lakhs and balance of 
Rs 15.60 Lakhs which is under dispute was admittedly paid in the later years. 
During the course of the hearing when asked, the ld. AR submitted at glance chart 
(PB 184) showing that the liability so created in the subjected year A.Y. 2010-11 
stood paid off in later years and in some cases where the cheques were not 
encashed by the awardee-payee, the same stood credited back to the scholarship 
expenses. Even in the order dt. 26.04.2018 (PB 176-183) of the Settlement 
Commission also, a categorical finding expressing satisfaction of this factual 
aspect based on their sample test checking, has been recorded. Even assuming for a 
moment such liability has been wrongly claimed this year but in the later years, 
remains outstanding for a long period, S. 41(1) takes care of the revenue’s 
interest. Further it not disputed that even in the past also similar scheme were 
floated and the remaining outstanding amount was claimed as a liability and some 
of the years were completed under scrutiny u/s 143(3) yet however, no similar 
disallowance had been made in the past. We find that in A.Y. 2019-20 also similar 
claim was made but no disallowance was made of similar nature although some 
other disallowances were made and reached to the stage of ITAT. Although the 
doctrine of res judicata do not apply in the income tax proceedings yet however, in41 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
absence of any change in the facts & circumstances of the case, the doctrine has 
been applied by the Courts. In the case of CIT v/s Excel Industries Ltd. (2013) 
358 ITR 295 (SC) , it was held that 
“Secondly, as noted by the Tribunal, a consistent view had been taken in favour of 
the assessee, starting with the AY 1992-93, that the benefits under the advance 
licences or under the duty entitlement pass book do not represent the real income 
of the assessee. Consequently, there was no reason to take a different view unless 
there are very convincing reasons, none of which had been pointed out by the 
Revenue. In Radhasoami Satsang Saomi Bagh v. Commissioner of Income Tax, 
[1992] 193 ITR 321 (SC) Court did not think it appropriate to allow the 
reconsideration of an issue for a subsequent AY if the same "fundamental aspect" 
permeates in different AYs. It appears from the record that in several AYs, the 
Revenue accepted the order of the Tribunal in favour of the assessee and did not 
pursue the matter any further but in respect of some AYs the matter was taken up 
in appeal before the High Court but without any success. That being so, the 
Revenue could not be allowed to flip-flop on the issue further.”  
 
We have also carefully gone through the decision cited by ld. AR in the cases of 
Bharat Earth Movers v/s CIT (2000) 162 CTR 325/245 ITR 428 (SC), CIT vs. 
Indian Transformers Ltd. (2004) 192 CTR 0216/270 ITR 0259 (KerHC), Calcutta 
Co. Ltd. v/s CIT (1959) 37 ITR 1 (SC) etc.  copy of which have also been supplied 
and are placed on record. However, we find that decision cited by the ld. DR are 
completely distinguishable based on peculiar facts available in those cases only, 
which are not obtaining in the present case. They were rendered in different legal 
factual context and therefore are not at all applicable. Thus, considering the totality 
of facts & circumstances and the legal position, we are of the considered opinion 
that the liability towards the amount payable under the scholarship scheme was42 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
rightly claimed and authorities below were not correct in disallowing the same. 
Hence, the disallowance so made is fully deleted. Therefore, this ground is 
allowed. 
 
6.1 The Ground of Appeal No.6 taken by the assesse consists of several grounds 
against disallowances of various expenses and are being dealt with hereunder issue 
wise: 
6.2 Disallowance of Rs.2,01,515/- on account of New Electricity Connection 
charges.  In Ground of Appeal No. 6.1 disallowance of Rs. 2,01,515/- made 
relating to the claim on account of electric connection charges, is agitated. The AO 
noted that the assessee had claimed expenditure of Rs.2,37,076/- for new 
electricity connection charges. When asked, the assessee stated that the charges so 
paid were for connection charges, electricity lines, supervision charges, CTPT set 
cost and meter cost but did not create any property. The AO however, feeling 
dissatisfied, disallowed Rs.2,01,515 after allowing depreciation @ 15% vide para 
2.5.3 pg 22 mainly on the ground that it is clearly a capital expenditure, which 
resulted into benefit of enduring nature. He placed reliance on Assam Bengal 
Cement Co. Ltd. v/s CIT (1955) 27 ITR 0034 (SC). However, the CIT(A) also 
confirmed the same.43 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
6.3 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions with prayers to delete 
the disallowance confirmed by the ld. CIT(A)  
1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the detailed written submissions filed 
before the ld. CIT(A),  which are reproduced at pg 32-33 & 37 of the order 
of CIT(A).  
 
2. The AO has not established that such expenditure resulted into creation of 
a new property or the assessee got an advantage of an enduring nature and 
hence, such a disallowance was wrongly made. The impugned disallowance 
may kindly be deleted in full.  
 
6.4 On the other hand, the ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings recorded by 
the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed by the ld. 
CIT(A) and prayed to uphold the addition/disallowance. 
6.5 We have heard both the parties and perused the materials available on 
record. A careful perusal of the facts and the material on record shows that the 
claimed expenditure of Rs. 2,37,076/- with, AO was on account of connection 
charges, electricity lines, supervision charges, CTPT set cost and meter cost as 
contended, (which is evident from the copies of invoices etc. APB 61 &104) such 
expenditure did not create any new asset and the facts as stated, remaining 
uncontroverted by the revenue, no disallowance was called for. The authorities 
below were not justified in making the disallowance hence, the same is hereby 
is deleted. Therefore, this ground is allowed.44 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
6.6 The Disallowance of Rs. 67,715/- claimed on account of Internet 
Networking expenses, is agitated by the AO. During the course of assessment 
proceedings the AO noted that the assessee had claimed expenditure of Rs. 
79,664/- for Internet networking expenses. When asked, the assessee stated that the 
charges so paid for increase effectiveness of business but not for creation of any 
asset. The AO however feeling dissatisfied, disallowed Rs. 67,715 after allowing 
depreciation @ 15% vide para 2.6.3 pg. 23 mainly on the ground that it is clearly a 
capital expenditure, which resulted into benefit of enduring nature. He placed 
reliance on Assam Bengal Cement Co. Ltd. v/s CIT (1955) 27 ITR 0034 (SC). 
However, the CIT(A) also confirmed the same.  
6.7 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions with prayer to delete 
the addition confirmed by the ld. CIT(A).  
1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the detailed written submissions filed 
before the ld. CIT(A),  which are reproduced at pg. 33 & 37 of the order of 
CIT(A).  
 
2. The AO has not established that such expenditure resulted into creation of 
a new property or the assessee got an advantage of an endeavouring nature 
and hence, such a disallowance was wrongly made. The impugned 
disallowance may kindly be deleted in full.  
 
6.8 On the other hand, the ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings recorded by 
the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed by the ld. 
CIT(A) and prayed to uphold the addition/disallowance.45 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
 
6.9 After hearing both the parties and perusing the materials available on record, 
we feel that Revenue has completely failed to establish as to how such expenditure 
has resulted into the creation of a new asset therefore, the authorities below were 
not correct in making the disallowance and hence the same is also deleted. Hence, 
this ground is allowed. 
6.10 Disallowance of Rs. 21,000/- on account of Name Transfer Fee:- In this 
ground the assessee challenged the Disallowance of Rs. 21,000/- claimed on 
account of Name Transfer Fee. The AO noted that the assessee had claimed 
expenditure of Rs. 21,000/- for Name transfer fee. When asked, the assessee stated 
that the charges were paid to Nagar Nigam, Kota for getting the name changed. 
The AO however feeling dissatisfied, disallowed the same vide para 2.7.3 pg. 24 
mainly on the ground that it is clearly a one-time expenditure and linked to 
acquisition of fixed asset. However, the ld. CIT(A) also confirmed the same. 
 
6.11 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions with prayer to delete 
the addition confirmed by the ld. CIT(A)  
1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the detailed written submissions filed 
before the ld. CIT(A),  which are reproduced at pg. 33 & 37 of the order of 
CIT(A).  
 
2. The AO has not established that such expenditure resulted into creation of 
a new property or the assessee got an advantage of an endeavouring nature46 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
and hence, such a disallowance was wrongly made. The impugned 
disallowance may kindly be deleted in full.  
 
6.12 On the other hand, the ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings recorded by 
the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed by the ld. 
CIT(A) and prayed to upheld the addition/disallowance. 
6.13 We have heard both the parties and perused the materials available on 
record. A careful consideration of the orders of the authorities below, rival 
contentions and the material placed on record, clearly shows that it was the case 
where the property was already purchased in CP-7, Indra Vihar, Kota. However, it 
was only a procedural formality of transferring the name was done whereupon, this 
amount was paid to the concerned authority i.e. Nagar Nigam, Kota, as evident 
from a copy placed at APB 151.  The AO has not established that such expenditure 
resulted into creation of a new property or the assessee got an advantage of an 
enduring nature and hence, such a disallowance was wrongly made. Hence 
impugned disallowance is hereby deleted in full. Therefore , this ground is 
allowed. 
6.14  Disallowance of Rs.7,80,642/- claimed on account of Construction 
Expenses of boundary wall of a building known as CP-14:- During the course of 
assessment proceedings,   The AO noted that the assessee had claimed 
Rs.7,80,642/- for expenses incurred for constructing boundary wall. When asked,47 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
the assessee stated that the various repair works got done including the extension 
of height of existing boundary wall. The AO however feeling dissatisfied, 
disallowed Rs.7,02,578/- after allowing depreciation @ 10% vide para 2.8.3 pg 25 
mainly on the ground that the expenditure was capital in nature and the assessee 
contention was neither convincing nor plausible. However, the ld. CIT(A) also 
confirmed the same. 
 
6.15 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions with prayer to delete 
the addition confirmed by the ld. CIT(A).  
1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the detailed written submissions filed 
before the ld. CIT(A),  which are reproduced at pg 38-39 of the order of 
CIT(A).  
 
2. The AO has not established that such expenditure resulted into creation of 
a new property or the assessee got an advantage of an endeavouring nature 
and hence, such a disallowance was wrongly made. The impugned 
disallowance may kindly be deleted in full. (Bill PB 146)  
 
6.16 On the other hand, the ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings recorded by 
the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed by the ld. 
CIT(A) and prayed to upheld the addition/disallowance. 
6.17  We have carefully considered the rival contention and the material placed 
on record. A reference has been made by the Ld. AR to the copy of invoice 
however it is a fact on the record that the height of the building was raised from the48 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
existing level . In that view of the matter, therefore we find the authorities below 
were justified in considering the expenditure of Rs. 7,80,642/- as capital 
expenditure and in allowing depreciation therefrom to assessee hence no 
interference is called for. This ground of appeal is therefore dismissed.  
6.18 Disallowance of Rs. 1,27,275/- claimed on account of Regularisation of the 
construction of Old Building:- During the course of assessment proceedings, the   
AO noted that the assessee had claimed expenditure of Rs. 79,664/- for Internet 
networking expenses. When asked, the assessee stated that the charges so paid for 
increase effectiveness of business but not for creation of any asset. The AO 
however feeling dissatisfied, disallowed Rs. 67,715 after allowing depreciation @ 
15% vide para 2.6.3 pg. 23 mainly on the ground that it is clearly a capital 
expenditure, which resulted into benefit of enduring nature. He placed reliance on 
Assam Bengal Cement Co. Ltd. v/s CIT (1955) 27 ITR 0034 (SC) also confirmed 
the same. However, the ld. CIT(A) also confirmed the same. 
6.19 Before us the ld. AR made the following submissions with prayer to delete 
the addition confirmed by the ld. CIT(A)  
1. Firstly, we strongly rely  upon the detailed written submissions filed 
before the ld. CIT(A),  which are reproduced at pg 35 of the order of 
CIT(A).49 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
2. Cases cited by Revenue are completely distinguishable: The AO relied 
upon certain decision in the cases of Haddi Venkataraman & Co. Pvt. Ltd. 
v/s CIT (1998) 229 ITR 0534 (SC), Haji Aziz & Abdul Shakool Bros. v/s CIT 
(1961) 41 ITR 0350 (SC) and Indian Aluminum Co. Ltd. v/s CIT (1971) 79 
ITR 0514 (SC). However, all those cases were based on the peculiar facts 
available in those cases only which are not obtaining in the present case. 
They were rendered in different legal factual context and therefore hence 
are not at all applicable being completely distinguishable and hence kindly 
be ignored.  
 
6.20 On the other hand, the ld. DR strongly relied upon the findings recorded by 
the authorities below and justified the additions made and confirmed by the ld. 
CIT(A) and prayed to uphold the addition/disallowance. 
6.21 We have heard both the parties and perused the materials available on 
record.  The disallowance has been made because there has been a violation of 
building by laws, hence, penalty was imposed by the Urban Improvement Trust, 
Kota, on account of unauthorised construction made. The Ld. CIT(A) also 
confirmed the disallowance. Looking at the undisputed facts of the case, that it was 
case of penalty, it was not allowable. The authorities below were justified in 
disallowing the claimed expenditure. Hence, this ground of the appeal is 
dismissed.  
7.0 Regarding Ground No. 5 relating to charging of interest u/s 234A, 234B, 
234C & 234D and withdrawal of interest u/s 244A of the Act, the levy and50 
 ITA246/JP/2015 
 M/S. ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE VS JCIT, RANGE-2, KOTA 
 
withdrawal of interest being consequential in nature, hence the AO is directed to 
act accordingly.  
8.0 In the result,  the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
