ORDER / आदेश  
Per  Rajesh Kumar, AM:  
 
This is an appeal  preferred by the assessee  again st the  order of the Ld.  
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal)-NFAC, Delhi (he reinafter referred to as the 
Ld. CIT(A)”]  dated 21.11.2022 for the AY 2006-07. 
2.    The only issue raised by the assessee in the various grounds of appeal is 
against the confirmation of addition of Rs. 1,23,40 ,000/- by Ld. CIT(A) as made by 
the AO in the assessment framed u/s 143(3)/254/143( 3) of the Act dated 11.03.2015 
on account of “Tenancy Vacancy Charges”.  
3. Facts in brief are that this is the second round  of appeal before the Tribunal. In 
the first round the Tribunal, vide order dated 23.0 5.2013 in ITA No. 1839/Kol/20122  
I.T.A. No. 49/Kol/2023 
Assessment Year: 2006-07 
Metropolitan Real Estates Pvt. Ltd.  
 
for AY 2006-07, set aside the appeal of the assesse  by  restoring the case to the file of 
AO with the directions to verify the agreements ent ered into the assessee with the 
tenants for payment of compensation for vacating th e property and since this being a 
company and following mercantile system of  account ing , the said tenancy vacancy 
charges of Rs. 1,23,40,000/- were to be allowed acc rual basis. The tribunal restored 
this issue because these  agreements were not  befo re the Tribunal nonetheless these  
agreements were before the authorities. The AO  exa mined these agreements and also 
investigated the issue by issuing notices u/s 133(6 ) to all the tenants however only  
three parties replied and notices to  two parties r emained unserved. The  AO treated 
these agreements as colourable device on the ground  that actual movement of funds 
could not be verified and thus disallowed the same adding   to the income of the 
assesse in the assessment framed u/s 143(3)/254/143 (3) dated 11.03.2015.  
4. In the appellate proceedings, the Ld. CIT(A) aga in affirmed the order of AO on 
the ground that payments against the Tenancy Vacanc y Charges  could not be verified.  
5. After hearing the rival contentions and perusing  the material on record 
including the decision of Co-ordinate Bench in ITA No. 1839/Kol/2012  for AY 2006-
07 dated 23.05.2013, we observe that case was resto red to the AO with the specific 
direction of in this case the to the AO to verify t he  agreements with the tenants which 
were not available before the AO. The operative par t of the decision in para 8  is 
extracted below for the sake of ready reference:  
“7. We have considered the rival submissions. A per usal of the assessment order clearly 
shows that the AO has disallowed the claim of tenan cy vacalion charges to the extent of Rs. 
1,.23,40,000/- on the ground that the same were con tingent in nature. He has taken the view 
that it is only in the event of vacating the plots of land by the respective tenants the real 
expenditure would be crystallized. A perusal of the  agreements entered into by the assessee 
with the purchasers clearly shows that it was the d uty of the assessee to provide vacant 
possession of the purchasers by May, 2009. A perusa l of the deed of declaration also clearly 
shows that if the vendor cannot give vacant possess ion the vendor would have to pay back the 
consideration to the purchaser along with the legal  expenses including stamp duty and 
interest. On the basis of this deed of declaration the purchasers have purchased the property 
for the consideration of Rs. 1,94,25,000/-. Before entering into the indenture of conveyance 
itself the assessee has entered into an agreement w ith the tenants for vacating the premises. 
The agreement with the tenants dated 20 th  February, 2006 and the agreements talk of handing 
over post dated cheques dated 31.03.2009, being the  last month before which tenants have to 
vacate the premises. A perusal of the indenture of conveyance with the deed of declaration as3  
I.T.A. No. 49/Kol/2023 
Assessment Year: 2006-07 
Metropolitan Real Estates Pvt. Ltd.  
 
also the agreement entered into by the assessee wit h the five tenants clearly show that if the 
agreement with the tenants show that without vacati ng of the premises the transaction would 
not be complete in respect of the sale of the prope rty. However, in so far as the indenture of 
conveyance has been entered into on 4th March, 2006  for the transfer of the immovable 
property as per the provision of section 2(47) of t he Act it would have to be held that the 
transfer took place during the assessment year 2006 -07. Admittedly when computing the 
income from business the assessee would be entitled  to all expenditures in relation to 
transaction., Admittedly the charges paid or payabl e in respect of the vacation of the.e-ants is 
an expenditure associated with the transaction of t he sale of the immovable property. Thus 
the assessee would be entitled to any and all expen ses which the assessee has incurred in 
connection with the transactions involving the sale  or transfer of the immovable property in 
question. It must also be understood that the asses see is a company and consequently must 
follow mercantile method of accounting . A perusal of the paper book filed before us shows 
that all the agreements entered into between the as sessee and the tenants are not before us 
though the assessee has claimed the same has been f iled before the AO. In the circumstances 
the issue of the expenses in relation to the tenanc y vacation charges debited to the‘extent of 
Rs. 1,23,40,000/- is restored to the file of the AO  to verify the agreements entered into by the 
assessee with the tenants. The AO is to examine whe ther the agreement have been entered 
into  during the year, the AO shall examine the cla im/as to whether the agreements are in 
relation to the land in question and the transactio ns in question. If the answer to both the 
issues are in the affirmative then the AO shall gra nt the assessee the benefit of the  deduction 
of the expenditure representing the tenancy vacant charges. 
We have also examined the agreement with the respec tive tenants and suit filed by the 
purchaser of the property  in the Court of Civil Ju dge, Junior Division, at Alipore 
against the assessee necessary decree and injunctio n claiming the refund of 
consideration already paid with interest of 15% and  compensation of Rs. 50,00,000/-
towards expenses on stamp duty etc. We also note th at out of five parties, three have 
responded to the notices issued u/s 133(6) of the A ct and admitted to have received 
the tenancy vacancy charges and only two do not res pond. Since the assesse is a 
private limited company and following mercantile sy stem of accounting, so the 
assesse has to be allowed these tenancy vacancy cha rges on accrual basis.In our 
opinion, the both the authorities  below have not c omplied with the directions given 
by the Tribunal and simply made the addition on the  ground that these  payments 
could not be verified. In our considered view this is in complete violation of direction 
given by the tribunal vide order dated 23.05.2013. The non service of notice us 133(6) 
of the Act can not be a ground for non compliance o f the tribunal direction. We have 
examined the agreements with the tenants and also t he suits filed by the purchaser in 
the court against the assesse. Therefore after cons idering the totality of the facts and 
circumstances and the order of the coordinate bench , we reverse the order of Ld.4  
I.T.A. No. 49/Kol/2023

CIT(A) and direct the AO to allow tenancy vacancy c harges of Rs. 1,23,40,000/- to 
the assessee.  
6. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is  al lowed.  
  Order is pronounced in the open court on   5th April, 2023
